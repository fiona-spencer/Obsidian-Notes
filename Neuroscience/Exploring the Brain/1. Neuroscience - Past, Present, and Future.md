# Introduction

- The Society for Neuroscience is that largest and fastest-growing association of professional scientists in all of experimental biology

# The Origins of Neuroscience

- Nervous system
	- Brain
	- Spinal cord
	- Nerves
- As early as 7000 people used trepanation, to research the brain
- In ancient history, it wast clear that the heart, not brain, was considered to be the seat of the soul and repository of memories

## Views of the Brain In Ancient Greece

- There is a correlation between structure and function
- The head is specialized for sensing the environment
	- Eyes, ears, nose, and tongue are connected
	- Nerves from these organs are traced through the skull into the brain
- Hippocrates (460-379 BCE) proposed the brain was involved in sensation and intelligence
	- Although this view was not widely accepted
- Aristotle (384-322 BCE) believed that the heart was the center of intellect
	- Proposed the brain to be a radiator for cooling of blood

## Views of the Brain During the Roman Empire


- Galen (130-200 AD), embraced Hippocratic view
	- Physician to the gladiators
	- Dissected sheep brain
		- 2 parts
			- Cerebrum
			- Cerebellum

- Cerebrum was soft, whereas the cerebellum was harder
- Galen suggested that the cerebrum received sensations and the cerebellum must command the muscle
- To form memories, sensations must be imprinted onto the brain
- The cerebrum, is largely concerned with sensations and perception, and the cerebellum is primarily a movement control centre
	- Cerebrum is a repository of memory
- Galen cut open the brain and found that it is hollow
- Hollow spaces, called ventricles, there is fluid
- Galen theorized that the body functioned according to a balance of 4 vital fluids, or humors
- Sensations were registered and movements initiated by the movement of humors to or from the brain ventricles via the nerves, like blood vessels

## Views of the Brain from the Renaissance to the 19th Century

- Galen's view of the brain lasted for almost 1500 years
- Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) added to the structure of the brain during the Renaissance
	- Ventricular localization of the brain remained
- In 17th century, French investors began developing hydraulically controlled mechanical devices
- Brain could be machine-like
- Fluid forced out of the ventricles through the nerves could "pump you up" and cause movement of the limbs

- Advocate of the fluid-mechanical theory of brain was Rene Descartes (1596-1650)
	- Theory could not explain full extent of brain behaviour
	- Unlike other animals, humans posses intellect and a God-given soul
	- Brain mechanisms control human behaviour only to the extent that the brain resembles that of the beasts
	- Mind is a spiritual entity that receives sensations and commands movement by communicating with the machinery of the brain via the pineal gland
- Modern neuroscience research support the mind has a physical basis, which is the brain
	- "Mind brain problem"
		- Human mind is distinct from the brain
- Brain tissues is divided into 2 parts
	- Gray matter
	- White matter
		-  Continuous with the nerves
		- Believed to contain the fibres that bring information to and from the gray matter
- Nervous system has a central division
	- Central nervous system (CNS)
		- Brain
			- Cerebrum
			- Cerebellum
			- Brain stem
		- Spinal cord
	- Peripheral nervous system (PNS)
		- Nerves
		- Nerve cells

- Same pattern of bumps (gryi) and grooves (sulci and fissures) could be identified on the surface of the brain in all individuals
- Pattern enables the parceling of the cerebrum into lobes
	- Basis for speculation that different functions might be localized to different bumps on the brain
	- Set stage for cerebral localization

## 19th Century Views of the Brain

Nervous system at the end of the 18th century
- Injury to the brain can disrupt sensations, movement, and thought and can cause death
- The brain communicates with the body via the nerves
- The brain has different identifiable parts, which probably perform different functions
- The brain operates like a machine and follows the laws of nature


### 4 Key Insights during the 19th Century

### 1) Nerves as Wires

- 1751, Benjamin Franklin published _Experiments and Observation on Electricity_
- Luigi Galvani and Emil du Bois-Reymond had shown that muscles can be caused to twitch when nerves are stimulated electrically and that the brain can generate electricity
	- Nerves communicate with the brain by the movement of fluid
	- Unresolved was whether the signals used the same wires to register sensations
	- Bidirectional communication along the same wires was suggested
		- When nerve is cut, there is a loss of both sensations and movement in region
	- Each nerve has many filaments, or nerve fibres, that carry information in a different direction
- 1810, Charles Bell and Francois Magendie
	- Just before the nerves attach to the spinal cord, the fibres divide into two branches, or roots
	- The dorsal root enters towards the back of the spinal cord, and ventral enters at the front
	- Bell test that these two spinal roots carry information in different directions by cutting each root separately and observing the consequences in experimental animals
	- Found that cutting only ventral roots caused muscle paralysis
	- Doral roots carry sensory information into the spinal cord
	- Within each nerve, there is a mixture of many wires
		- Some send information in or out of the spinal cord
	- In each sensory and motor nerve fibre, transmission is strictly one-way
	- Two fibres are bundled together for most of their length, but are anatomically segregated when they enter or exit the spinal cord

### 2) Localization of Specific Functions to Different Parts of the Brain

- In 1811, Bell proposed the origin of the motor fibres is the cerebellum and the destination of sensory fibres is the cerebrum
	- To identify the functions of the spinal roots, they destroyed parts of the brain and tested for sensory and motor deficits
		- Called experimental ablation method
	- 1823, Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens use this in birds to show that the cerebellum does indeed play a role in the coordination of movement
	- Cerebrum is involved in sensation and perception, as Bell and Galen suggested

- In 1809 Franz Joesph Gall believed that the bumps on the surface of the skull reflect the bumps on the surface of the brain
	- Proposed the propensity for certain personality traits, such as generosity, secretiveness, and destructiveness, cloud be related to the dimensions of the head
	- Measured skulls representing the extensive range of personality types
	- Called phrenology

![](Pasted%20image%2020250529140303.png)

- Critics fo phrenology was Flourens
	- Shape of the the skull is not correlated with the shape of the brain
	- Particular traits are not isolated to the portions of the cerebrum
	- All regions of the cerebrum participate equally in cerebral functions (later proven false)
- Paul Broca credited proving localization of function in cerebrum
	- Presented a patient who could understand language but not speak
	- Brain has a lesion in the left frontal lobe
	- Region of the human cerebrum was responsible for production of speech

![](Pasted%20image%2020250529140324.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250529140439.png)

- 1870, Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig showed that applying small electrical currents to circumscribed regions of exposed surface of the brain of a god could elicit discrete movements
- 1881, David Ferrier repeated showing that removal of the same region of the cerebrum causes paralysis of the muscles
- Hermann Munk using ablation presented evidence that the occipital lobe was required for vision

- Unlike phrenologists, scientists today require solid experimental evidence before attributing a specific function to a portion of the brain

### 3) The Evolution of Nervous Systems

- 1859, Charles Darwin published _On the Origin of Species_
	- Theory of evolution
		- Species of organisms evolved from a common ancestor
		- Behaviour among the heritable traits could evolved
	- Behaviour reflects the activity of the nervous system, we can infer that the brain mechanisms that underlie this fear reaction may be similar across these species

![](Pasted%20image%2020250529141102.png)

- Electrical impulse conduction along nerve fibres on squid are now know to apply equally well to humans
	- Rats show clear signs of addicition if given cocaine repeadedly


![](Pasted%20image%2020250529141129.png)

- Many behavioural traits are highly specialized for environment (or niche) a species occupies
	- Moneys swing on branches have improved sight
	- Rats in underground tunnels have poor vision, but a highly evolved sense of touch


### 4) The Neuron: The Basic Functional Unit of the Brain

- 1839, Theodor Schwamm proposed _cell theory_
	- All tissues are composed of microscopic units called cells
	- Nerve cells usually have a number of thin projections, or processes, that extend from a central cell body
	- "Nerve net" of connected nerve cell would represent elementary unit of brain function
- By 1900, individual nerve cell, was called neuron, and was recognized to be the basic functional unit of the nervous system
