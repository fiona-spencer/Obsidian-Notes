# Introduction

- The Society for Neuroscience is that largest and fastest-growing association of professional scientists in all of experimental biology

# The Origins of Neuroscience

- Nervous system
	- Brain
	- Spinal cord
	- Nerves
- As early as 7000 people used trepanation, to research the brain
- In ancient history, it wast clear that the heart, not brain, was considered to be the seat of the soul and repository of memories

## Views of the Brain In Ancient Greece

- There is a correlation between structure and function
- The head is specialized for sensing the environment
	- Eyes, ears, nose, and tongue are connected
	- Nerves from these organs are traced through the skull into the brain
- Hippocrates (460-379 BCE) proposed the brain was involved in sensation and intelligence
	- Although this view was not widely accepted
- Aristotle (384-322 BCE) believed that the heart was the center of intellect
	- Proposed the brain to be a radiator for cooling of blood

## Views of the Brain During the Roman Empire


- Galen (130-200 AD), embraced Hippocratic view
	- Physician to the gladiators
	- Dissected sheep brain
		- 2 parts
			- Cerebrum
			- Cerebellum

- Cerebrum was soft, whereas the cerebellum was harder
- Galen suggested that the cerebrum received sensations and the cerebellum must command the muscle
- To form memories, sensations must be imprinted onto the brain
- The cerebrum, is largely concerned with sensations and perception, and the cerebellum is primarily a movement control centre
	- Cerebrum is a repository of memory
- Galen cut open the brain and found that it is hollow
- Hollow spaces, called ventricles, there is fluid
- Galen theorized that the body functioned according to a balance of 4 vital fluids, or humors
- Sensations were registered and movements initiated by the movement of humors to or from the brain ventricles via the nerves, like blood vessels

## Views of the Brain from the Renaissance to the 19th Century

- Galen's view of the brain lasted for almost 1500 years
- Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) added to the structure of the brain during the Renaissance
	- Ventricular localization of the brain remained
- In 17th century, French investors began developing hydraulically controlled mechanical devices
- Brain could be machine-like
- Fluid forced out of the ventricles through the nerves could "pump you up" and cause movement of the limbs

- Advocate of the fluid-mechanical theory of brain was Rene Descartes (1596-1650)
	- Theory could not explain full extent of brain behaviour
	- Unlike other animals, humans posses intellect and a God-given soul
	- Brain mechanisms control human behaviour only to the extent that the brain resembles that of the beasts
	- Mind is a spiritual entity that receives sensations and commands movement by communicating with the machinery of the brain via the pineal gland
- Modern neuroscience research support the mind has a physical basis, which is the brain
	- "Mind brain problem"
		- Human mind is distinct from the brain
- Brain tissues is divided into 2 parts
	- Gray matter
	- White matter
		-  Continuous with the nerves
		- Believed to contain the fibres that bring information to and from the gray matter
- Nervous system has a central division
	- Central nervous system (CNS)
		- Brain
			- Cerebrum
			- Cerebellum
			- Brain stem
		- Spinal cord
	- Peripheral nervous system (PNS)
		- Nerves
		- Nerve cells

- Same pattern of bumps (gryi) and grooves (sulci and fissures) could be identified on the surface of the brain in all individuals
- Pattern enables the parceling of the cerebrum into lobes
	- Basis for speculation that different functions might be localized to different bumps on the brain
	- Set stage for cerebral localization

Lobes of the Cerebrum
1. Frontal lobe
2. Central sulcus
3. Parietal lobe
4. Occipital lobe
5. Temporal lobe

## 19th Century Views of the Brain

Nervous system at the end of the 18th century
- Injury to the brain can disrupt sensations, movement, and thought and can cause death
- The brain communicates with the body via the nerves
- The brain has different identifiable parts, which probably perform different functions
- The brain operates like a machine and follows the laws of nature


### 4 Key Insights during the 19th Century

### 1) Nerves as Wires

- 1751, Benjamin Franklin published _Experiments and Observation on Electricity_
- Luigi Galvani and Emil du Bois-Reymond had shown that muscles can be caused to twitch when nerves are stimulated electrically and that the brain can generate electricity
	- Nerves communicate with the brain by the movement of fluid
	- Unresolved was whether the signals used the same wires to register sensations
	- Bidirectional communication along the same wires was suggested
		- When nerve is cut, there is a loss of both sensations and movement in region
	- Each nerve has many filaments, or nerve fibres, that carry information in a different direction
- 1810, Charles Bell and Francois Magendie
	- Just before the nerves attach to the spinal cord, the fibres divide into two branches, or roots
	- The dorsal root enters towards the back of the spinal cord, and ventral enters at the front
- Bell test that these two spinal roots carry information in different directions by cutting each root separately and observing the consequences in experimental animals
- Found that
