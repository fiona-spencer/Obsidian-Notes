# Introduction

- The action potential is the signal that conveys information in the nervous system
- The action potential is a rapid reversal and is called a "spike" when the inside becomes positive
- The action potentials are similar in size and duration, and do not diminish down the axon
- The frequency and pattern of action potentials constitute the code used by neurons to transfer information from one location to another

# Properties of the Action Potential

## The Ups and Downs of an Action Potential

- The membrane potential ($V_m$) is determined by inserting a micro-electrode in the cell
- A voltmeter is used to measure the electrical potential difference between the top of the intracellular micro-electrode and another placed outside the cell
- During action potential, the membrane potential becomes positive
	- Occurs 100x faster than blink of an eye
- A special voltmeter, oscilloscope, is used to study acton potentials

Parts of a Membrane Potential Graph
1) Rising phase
	1) Rapid depolarization of the membrane
	2) $V_m$ reaches a peak of 40 mV
2) Overshoot
	1) Inside is positively charged
3) Falling phase
	1) Rapid repolarization, until membrane is more negative than resting
4) Undershoot/after-hyperpolarization
	1) Gradual restoration of the resting potential

- The entire action potential lasts ~ 2 ms

## The Generation of an Action Potential

- The perception of sharp pain where a thumbtack enters your foot is caused by the generation of action potential in certain nerve fibers in the skin
- Membrane of these fibers posses a type of gated sodium channel that opens when the nerve ending is stretched
	- Thumbtack enters the skin
	- Membrane of the nerve fibres in the skin is stretched
	- $Na^+$ permeable channel open
	- Membrane becomes depolarized (generator potential)
	- At critical level of depolarization, the membrane will generate an action potential (threshold)
	- Action potentials are caused by depolarization of the membrane beyond threshold
	- Neurons can be depolarized by injecting electrical current through a micro-electrode, a method used by neuroscientists
		- Similar to a shutter button on a camera
	- Action potentials are said to be "all-or-none"


## The Generation of Multiple Action Potential

- Continued pressure on the "shutter button" beyond threshold would cause the camera to shoot frame after frame
- If we pass continuous depolarizing current into a neuron, many action potentials are generated in succession

- The rate of AP (action potential) depends on the magnitude of the continuous depolarizing current
- Just above threshold might fire AP at a rate of 1 per second, or 1 hertz
- Firing frequency of action potentials reflects the magnitude of the depolarizing current
- There is a limit to the rate at which a neuron can generate AP
- Max firing frequency is ~1000 Hz
- One an AP is initiated, it is impossible to initiate another for ~1 msec
- This period is called the absolute refractory period
- Relative refractory period, is the amount of current required oofdepolarize the neuron to action potential threshold is elevated above normal

#### Methods of Recording Action Potentials


# The Action Potential, In Theory

- Depolarization of the cell during the AP is caused by the influx of sodium ions across the membrane, and repolarization is caused by the efflux of potassium ions

## Membrane Currents and Conductances

3 Types of Protein molecules
1) Sodium-potassium pimps
2) Potassium channels
3) Sodium channels

- Pump work continuously to establish and maintain concentration gradient
- Both potassium channels and the sodium channels are closed
- When the potassium channel is open, ions will flow out of the cell

Movement of $K^+$ from 0 mV to -80 mV
1. The net movement across the membrane is an electrical current ($I_K$)
2. The number of open potassium channels is proportional to the electrical conductance ($g_K$)
3. Membrane current, will flow only as long $V_m \notequal E_K$


Relationship

$I_{ion} = g_K (V_m - E_{ion})$
