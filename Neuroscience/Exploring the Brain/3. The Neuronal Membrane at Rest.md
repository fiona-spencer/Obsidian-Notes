# Introduction

- In the spinal cord, a sudden pain is translated into neural signals that travel rapidly and reliably up the long sensory nerves of your leg
	- Signals atre transferred to interneurons
	- Some connect with interpret the signal as painful, and other motor neurons that control the leg muscles
- The type of signal used by neurons is constrained by the special environment of the nervous system
- Electrical charge in the cytosol of the axon is carries by electrically charge atoms (ions) instead of free electron
	- Cytosol is less conductive than copper wire
	- Axon is not insulated and is bathed in salty extracellular fluid, which conducts electricity
	- The nerve impulse, or action potential overcomes that biological constraints

- Action potentials do not diminish over distance
- Information is encoded in the frequency of action potential of individual neurons, as well as in the distribution and number of neurons firing action potentials in a given nerve
	- Morse code
- Nerve and muscle cells are able to generate and conduct action potentials
	- Have a excitable membrane
- The cell with excitable membrane is generated when it is at rest
- In a resting neuron, the cytosol inside the surface of the membrane has a negative electrical charge
	- Called resting membrane potential (resting potential)
- Action potential is the reversal of this, and an instant (one thousandth of a second) the inside of the membrane becomes positively charged

# The Cast of Chemicals

3 Main Properties that Affect Resting Potential
1. Salty fluids on either side of the membrane
2. Membrane
3. Proteins in membrane


## Cytosol and Extracellular Fluid

- Water is the main ingredient of the fluid inside the neuron
- Electrically charges atoms (ions) are dissolved in the water, and responsible for the resting and action potentials
Neuron
- Intracellular fluid/cytosol
- Extracellular fluid, fluid that bathes the neuron


### Water

- Water has a uneven distribution of electrical charge (polar covalent bond)
	- 2 hydrogen atoms
	- 1 oxgen atom
- Shares elections will spend more time associated with oxygen atom that with the hydrogen atoms
	- Oxygen atom has a net negative charge
	- Hydrogen has net positive charge
- Water is an efficient solvent of other charge or polar molecules

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531001702.png)


### Ions

- Ions are atoms or molecules that have a new electrical charge
	- Sodium
	- Chloride
- Salt dissolved readily in water because the charged portions of the water molecular have a stronger attraction for the ions that they have for each other
- Clouds of water that surround each ion are called spheres of hydration, used to insulated the ions from one another
- Electrical charge of an atom depends on the different between the number of protons and electron
	- Difference
		- 1 - monovalent
		- 2 - Divalent
**Cations** - ions with a new positive charge
**Anions** - ions with a new negative charge


Major Charge Carries for Conduction of Electricity in Biological Systems
1) Sodium ($Na^+$)
2) Potassium ($K^+$)
3) Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$)
4) Chloride ($Cl^-$)

## The Phospholipid Membrane

- Ions and polar molecules are "water loving" or hydrophilic
- Non polar molecular are hydrophobic
	- Oil
- Lipids are the neuronal membrane and contribute to the resting and action potentials by forming a barrier to water-soluble ions

### The Phospholipid Bilayer

- Building block of cell membranes are phospholipids
	- Non-polar chains of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms
	- Polar phosphate group at one end of the molecular
- Neuronal membrane consists of a sheet of phospholipids, two molecules thick

## Protein

Protein Uses
- Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in neurons
- Cytoskeleton give a neuron its shape
- Receptors are sensitive to neurotransmitter
- Resting and action potential depends on special proteins in phospholipid bilayer

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531004321.png)

### Protein Structure

- Proteins are molecules from a combinations of 20 different amino acids
- All amino acids have a central carbon atom ($\alpha$-carbon)
	- Covalently bonded to four molecular groups
		- Hydrogen atom
		- Amino group ($NH_3^+$)
		- Carboxyl group ($COO^-$)
		- R-group


![](Pasted%20image%2020250531004559.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531004622.png)

- The properties of the R group determine chemical relationship in which each amino acid can participate
- Proteins are synthesized by the ribosomes of the neuronal cell body
- Amino acids assemble into a chain connected by peptide bonds
	- Join the amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of the next

**Polypeptides** - proteins made of a single chain of amino acids

4 Structure Levels
1. Primary structure
2. Secondary structure
3. Tertiary structure
4. Quaternary structure


![](Pasted%20image%2020250531004907.png)

- Each polypeptide in the quaternary structure is a subunit

### Channel Proteins

- Surface of a protein may be chemically heterogenous
- Regions of exposed non-polar R groups are hydrophobic and associate with lipid
- Regions with exposed polar R groups are hydrophilic and avoid lipid

**Ion channels** - membrane-spanning protein molecular, with exposed hydrophilic at each end, and hydrophobic in the middle
- Require 4-6 similar proteins to form a pore
- Composition of channel can change the ion selectivity
- Channels with gating can be opened and closed by changes in the local microenvironment of the membrane

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531005627.png)

### Ion Pumps

- Ion pumps are also membrane-spanning proteins
- Ion pumps have enzymes that use energy released from the breakdown of ATP to transport certain ions across the membrane
	- Transports $Na^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$

# The Movement of Ions

- Ionic movements through channels
1. Diffusion
2. Electricity

## Diffusion

- Ions and molecular dissolved in water are in constant motion
- Net movement of ions from region of high concentration to low concentration (diffusion)
- Ions will flow down a concentration gradient
- Diffusion of ions
	- Membrane posses channels permeable to the ions
	- Concentration gradient across the membrane

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531010127.png)

#### Molarity
- Concentrations of substance are expressed as the number of molecular per litre of solution
- The number of molecular is expressed in _moles_
- 1 mole (M) = $6.02$ x $10^{23}$ if it has a concentration of 1 mole/L
- A 1 millimolar (mM) solution has 0.001 moles/L
	- [NaCl] = 1 mM


## Electricity
- Another way to induce a new movement of ions in a solution is to use an electrical field
- In a NaCl solution there will net a new movement of Na+ to the negative terminal and Cl- to the positive terminal
	- Electrical current (I) in amperes
- Current is the electrical charge from positive to negative
	- Positive current flows in the direction of Na+ from anode to the cathode

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531122752.png)

**Electrical potential/voltage (V)** - the force exerted on a charge particle, and it reflects the different in charge between the anode and cathode
- Current increases as voltage increases
- Car batter has 12 volts

**Electrical conductance (g)** - the relative ability of an electrical charge to migrate from one point to another
- Measured in siemens (S)
- Depends on number of particles available to carry electrical charge

**Electrical resistance (R)** - the relative inability of an electrical charge to migrate
- Measures in ohms ($\ohm$)
- Resistance is the inverse of conductance

$R = \frac{1}{g}$

Ohm's Law

I = gV

- Current is the product of the conducatance and potential different

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531122803.png)

- No current will flow if there are no channels to migrate Na+ and Cl- across the membrane
	- Conductance of the membrane is zero
- Ions can cross the membrane only by way of protein channels

# The Ionic Basis of the Resting Membrane Potential

- The membrane potential is the voltage across the neuronal membrane at any moment ($V_m$)
	- Measures by inserting a micro-electrode into the cytosol
	- A micro-electrode is a this glass tube with a fine tip that will penetrate the membrane of a neuron with minimal damage
	- Filled with salt solution and connected to a voltmeter
	- Electrical charge is unevenly distributed across the neuronal membrane
	- Inside is electrically negative with respect to the outside
- The resting potential of a neuron is ~ -65 mV

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531123310.png)


## Equilibrium Potentials

- When the phospholipid bilayer is impermeable there is not potential different
- If a phospholipid bilayer is able to diffuse only K+, the potassium would follow the steep concentration gradient, causing the inside to be negatively charged
- The electrical potential different is eventually balanced (ionic equilibrium potential)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531123333.png)

1. Large changes in membrane potential are caused by minuscule changes in ionic concentrations
2. The net difference in electrical charge occurs at the inside and outside surfaces of the membrane
	1. Ions on one side interact electrostatically with ions on the other side
	2. Membrane stores electrical charge, called capacitance
3. Ions are driven across the membrane at a rate proportional to the difference between the membrane potential and the equilibrium potential

**Ionic driving force** - the difference between the real membrane potential and the equiliurbuim potential

($V_m - E_{ion}$)

4. If the concentration difference across the membrane is known for an ion, an equilibrium potential can be calculated for that ion

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531135317.png)


![](Pasted%20image%2020250531135352.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531135404.png)

- If we know the ionic concentration difference across the membrane, we can figure out the equilibrium potential for any ion

### The Nernst Equation

- Each ion has its own equilibrium potential
	- Potassium equilibrium potential
	- Sodium equilibrium potential
	- Calcium equilibrium potential
- The exact value of an equilibrium potential in mV is calculated using Nernst equation
	- Charge of the ion
	- Temperature
	- Ratio of the external and internal ion concentrations

$E_k = -80 mV$


Ex. Equilibrium potential for an ion

$E_{ion} = 2.303 \frac{RT}{zF}log\frac{[ion]_o}{[ion]_i}$

$E_{ion}$ - ionic equilibrium potential
$R$ - gas constant
$T$ - absolute temperature
$z$ - charge of the ion
$F$ - Faraday's constant
$log$ - base 10 logarithm
$[ion]_o$ - ionic concentration outside the cell
$[ion]_i$ - ionic concentration inside the cell

- Derived from the principles of physical chemistry
- Increasing the thermal energy increases diffusion, and therefor potential difference
	- $E_{ion}$ is proportional to T
- Increasing electrical charge will decrease the potential difference
	- $E_{ion}$ is inversely proportional to Z

- Body temperature is 37C

$E_K = 61.54$ mV $log \frac{[K^+]_o}{[K^+]_i}$

$E_{Na} = 61.54$ mV $log \frac{[Na^+]_o}{{Na^+}_i}$

$E_{Cl} = - 61.54$ mV $log \frac{[Cl^-]_o}{[Cl^-]_i}$

$E_{Ca} = 61.54$ mV $log \frac{[Ca^{2+}]_o}{[Ca^{2+}]_i}$

- To calculate the equilibrium potential of a certain ion at body temperature, we need the ionic concentrations on either side

$\frac{[K^+]_o}{[K^+]_i} = \frac{1}{20}$

$log\frac{1}{20} = -1.3$

$E_k = 61.54$ mV x -1.3

= -80 mV

- There is no term in the Nernst equation for permeability or ionic conductance


## The Distribution of Ions Across the Membrane

- $K^-$ is more concentrated on the inside, and $Na^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$ are more concentrated on the outside
- Ionic concentration gradients are established by the actions of ion pumps in neuronal membrane
	- Sodium-potassium pump
	- Calcium pump
- S-P pump is an enzyme that breaks down ATP in the presence of internal $Na^+$
	- Exchanges internal $Na^+$ for external $K^+$
- S-P pump expends as much as 70% of the total amount of ATP utilized by the brain

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531141542.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531141553.png)

- The calcium pump is also an enzyme that transports $Ca^{2+}$ out of the cytosol across the cell membrane
- Mitochondria and types of endoplasmic reticulum also help to decrease intracellular calcium

## Relative Ion Permeabilities of the Membrane At Rest

- Neurons are not permeable to only a single type of ion
- If the membrane of a neuron were permeable only to $K^+$, the membrane potential would be $E_K$ = -80 mV
- For $Na^+$, $E_{Na}$ = 62 mV
- The resting membrane potential can be calculated using the Goldman equation, that takes the relative permeability of the membrane of different ions
- If the resting membrane permeability to $K^+$ is 40-fold greater than $Na^+$ then the resting membrane potential is -65 mV


#### Goldman Equation

$V_m = 61.54$ mV $log\frac{P_K[K^+]_o + P_{Na}[Na^+]_o}{P_K[K^+]_i + P_{Na}[Na^+]_i}$

$V_m = 61.54$ mV  $log\frac{40(5) + 1(50)}{40(100) + 1(5)}$

$= 61.54$ mV $log\frac{350}{4015}$

$= -65$ mV

### The Wide World of Potassium Channels

- Selectivity for $K^+$ derives from the arrangement of amino acid residues that line the pore regions of the channels
- Very large number of different potassium channels were found responsible for the maintenance for the resting membrane potential in neurons
- The pore loop, contributes to the selectivity filter that makes the channel permeable mostly to $K^+$ ions
- Mutations involving only a single amino acid in the potassium channel can severely disrupt neuronal function
- Increased sodium permeability causes the membrane potential of neurons to become less negative, disrupting neuronal function
- The absence of normal negative membrane potential in the cerebellum region is the cause of death in the strain of mice called _Waver_
- Some neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, is caused by mutations of specific potassium channels

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531143220.png)

#### The Atomic Structure of a Potassium Channel

- Toxins functions as a plug on the pore, and it interacts with ions inside the pore

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531151109.png)


### The Importance of Regulating the External Potassium Concentration

- Membrane potential is sensitive to changes in the concentration of extracellular potassium
- A tenfold change in the $K^+$ concentration outside the cell from 5 to 10 nM, would take the membrane potential from -65 to -17 mV

**Depolarization** - a change in the membrane potential from the normal resting value to a less negative value of the membrane

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531151321.png)

- Blood-brain barrier, a specialization of the walls of brain capillaries that limit the movement of potassium into the extracellular fluid of the brain
- Gili, particularly astrocytes, possess efficient mechanisms to take up extracellular $K^+$
- The mechanisms for regulation of $[K^+]_o$ by astrocytes is called potassium spatial buffering
- Muscle cells, do not have a blood brain barrier or glial buffering mechanisms

# Concluding Remarks


#### Death by Lethal Injection

- To choose death, Mrs. Adkins injected a solution of potassium chloride
- The anesthetic caused unconsciousness by suppressing the activity of neurons in part of the brain called the reticular formation
- Functioning of excitable cell requires that their membrane be maintained at the resting potential when they are not generating impulses
- A tenfold rise in extracellular $K^+$ would wipe out the resting potential
- Although neurons are protected from large changes of potassium, muscle cells are not
- Cardiac muscle cell can no longer generate impulses that lead to contraction, that stops the heart
- Intravenous potassium chloride ultimately caused a cardiac arrest
