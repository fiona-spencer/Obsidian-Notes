# Introduction

- In the spinal cord, a sudden pain is translated into neural signals that travel rapidly and reliably up the long sensory nerves of your leg
	- Signals atre transferred to interneurons
	- Some connect with interpret the signal as painful, and other motor neurons that control the leg muscles
- The type of signal used by neurons is constrained by the special environment of the nervous system
- Electrical charge in the cytosol of the axon is carries by electrically charge atoms (ions) instead of free electron
	- Cytosol is less conductive than copper wire
	- Axon is not insulated and is bathed in salty extracellular fluid, which conducts electricity
	- The nerve impulse, or action potential overcomes that biological constraints

- Action potentials do not diminish over distance
- Information is encoded in the frequency of action potential of individual neurons, as well as in the distribution and number of neurons firing action potentials in a given nerve
	- Morse code
- Nerve and muscle cells are able to generate and conduct action potentials
	- Have a excitable membrane
- The cell with excitable membrane is generated when it is at rest
- In a resting neuron, the cytosol inside the surface of the membrane has a negative electrical charge
	- Called resting membrane potential (resting potential)
- Action potential is the reversal of this, and an instant (one thousandth of a second) the inside of the membrane becomes positively charged

# The Cast of Chemicals

3 Main Properties that Affect Resting Potential
1. Salty fluids on either side of the membrane
2. Membrane
3. Proteins in membrane


## Cytosol and Extracellular Fluid

- Water is the main ingredient of the fluid inside the neuron
- Electrically charges atoms (ions) are dissolved in the water, and responsible for the resting and action potentials
Neuron
- Intracellular fluid/cytosol
- Extracellular fluid, fluid that bathes the neuron


### Water

- Water has a uneven distribution of electrical charge (polar covalent bond)
	- 2 hydrogen atoms
	- 1 oxgen atom
- Shares elections will spend more time associated with oxygen atom that with the hydrogen atoms
	- Oxygen atom has a net negative charge
	- Hydrogen has net positive charge
- Water is an efficient solvent of other charge or polar molecules

### Ions

- Ions are atoms or molecules that have a new electrical charge
	- Sodium
	- Chloride
- Salt dissolved readily in water because the charged portions of the water molecular have a stronger attraction for the ions that they have for each other
- Clouds of water that surround each ion are called spheres of hydration, used to insulated the ions from one another
- Electrical charge of an atom depends on the different between the number of protons and electron
	- Difference
		- 1 - monovalent
		- 2 - Divalent
**Cations** - ions with a new positive charge
**Anions** - ions with a new negative charge


Major Charge Carries for Conduction of Electricity in Biological Systems
1) Sodium ($Na^+$)
2) Potassium ($K^+$)
3) Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$)
4) Chloride ($Cl^-$)

## The Phospholipid Membrane

- Ions and polar molecules are "water loving" or hydrophilic
- Non polar molecular are hydrophobic
	- Oil
- Lipids are the neuronal membrane and contribute to the resting and action potentials by forming a barrier to water-soluble ions

### The Phospholipid Bilayer

- Building block of cell membranes are phospholipids
	- Non-polar chains of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms
	- Polar phosphate group at one end of the molecular
- Neuronal membrane consists of a sheet of phospholipids, two molecules thick

## Protein

Protein Uses
- Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in neurons
- Cytoskeleton give a neuron its shape
- Receptors are sensitive to neurotransmitter
- Resting and action potential depends on special proteins in phospholipid bilayer

### Protein Structure

- Proteins are molecules from a combinations of 20 different amino acids
- All amino acids have a central carbon atom ($\alpha$-carbon)
	- Covalently bonded to four molecular groups
		- Hydrogen atom
		- Amino group ($NH_3^+$)
		- Carboxyl group ($COO^-$)
		- R-group

![](Pasted%20image%2020250531004622.png)

- The properties of the R group determine chemical relationship in which each amino acid can participate
- Proteins are synthesized by the ribosomes of the neuronal cell body
- Amino acids assemble into a chain connected by peptide bonds
	- Join the amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of the next

**Polypeptides** - proteins made of a single chain of amino acids

4 Structure Levels
1. Primary structure
2. Secondary structure
3. Tertiary structure
4. Quaternary structure


![](Pasted%20image%2020250531004907.png)

- Each polypeptide in the quaternary structure is a subunit

### Channel Proteins

- Surface of a protein may be chemically heterogenous
- Regions of exposed non-polar R groups are hydrophobic and associate with lipid
- Regions with exposed polar R groups are hydrophilic and avoid lipid

**Ion channels** - membrane-spanning protein molecular, with exposed hydrophilic at each end, and hydrophobic in the middle
- Require 4-6 similar proteins to form a pore
- Composition of channel can change the ion selectivity
- Channels with gating can be opened and closed by changes in the local microenvironment of the membrane

### Ion Pumps

- Ion pumps are also membrane-spanning proteins
- Ion pumps have enzymes that use energy released from the breakdown of ATP to transport certain ions across the membrane
	- Transports $Na^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$

# The Movement of Ions

- Ionic movements through channels
1. Diffusion
2. Electricity

## Diffusion

- Ions and molecular dissolved in water are in constant motion
- Net movement of ions from region of high concentration to low concentration (diffusion)
- Ions will flow down a concentration gradient
- Diffusion of ions
	- Membrane posses channels permeable to the ions
	- Concentration gradient across the membrane

#### Molarity
- Concentrations of substance are expressed as the number of molecular per litre of solution
- The number of molecular is expressed in _moles_
- 1 mole (M) = $6.02$ x $10^{23}$ if it has a concentration of 1 mole/L
