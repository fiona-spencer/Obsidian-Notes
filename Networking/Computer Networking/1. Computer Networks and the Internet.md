# What Is the Internet?

## A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

- End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches
- Physical media
	- Coaxial cable
	- Copper wire
	- Optical fiber
	- Radio spectrum

- Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bit/second
- The data segments are known as a packet, and reassembled and the destination end systems
- A packet switch takes a packet arriving and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links
- Packet switches
	- Routers
		- Network core
	- Link-layer switches
		- Access networks
- The sequence of communication is a route or path
- End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- Each ISP network, is managed independently, and runs the IP protocol
- End systems, packet switches, and other pieces run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information
- Protocols
	- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
	- Internet Protocol (IP)
		- Specifies the format of the packets
- Protocols are known as TCP/IP
- Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- Standard documents are called request for comments (RFCs)
	- Define TCP, IP, HTTP, and SMTP
	- The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards

## A Service Description

- Application are distributed applications and involved multiple end systems that exchange data with each other
- Internet applications run on end systems
- Languages
	- Java
	- C
	- Python
- End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies how a program running on one end systems asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination

## What Is a Protocol?

- Hardware implemented protocols in two connected computers control the flow of bits
- Congestion control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver
- Protocols in routers determine a packet's path from source to destination

- A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event

# The Network Edge

- End systems
	- Computers
	- Servers
	- Mobile devices
- End systems are referred to as hosts because they host application programs
- Hosts
	- Clients
	- Servers
- Most servers reside in large data centres

## Access Networks

_Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite_

- Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable
- A residence obtains DSL internet from the telephone company (telco) that provides its wires local phone access
- Telco also provides an ISP
- Home DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to CO (central office), analog signals from houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM (digital subscriber line access multiplexer)

	- A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
	- A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
	- An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

![](Pasted%20image%2020250621112816.png)

- A splitter separates the data and telephone signals arriving to the home and forwards the data signal to the DSL modem
- On the telco side, in the CO, the DSLAM separate the data and phone signals and sends the data into the Internet
	- 12 Mbps downstream
	- 1.8 Mbps upstream
- Downstream and upstream rates are different; asymmetric
- Maximum rate is limited by the distance between the home and the CO
- DSL is designed for short distances
	- 5 to 10 miles of CO
- Cable Internet access makes use of cable television infrastructure
- Fiber optics connect the cable head end to neighbourhood-level junction, and coaxial cable is then used to reach individual homes
- The fiber and coaxial cable are called hybrid fiber coax (HFC)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250621113235.png)


- Cable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems
- Cable modem is an external device that connect the PC through an Ethernet port
- Cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network's DSLAM
	- Analog signal into digital format
- Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels
	- Downstream (higher transmission)
	- Upstream
- DOCSIS 2.0 standard
	- Downstream rates = 42.8 Mbps
	- Upstream rates = 30.7 Mbps

- Cable Internet access is a shared broadcast medium
- Every packet sent travels downstream on every link to every home, and upstream to the head end
- A distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions
- DSL and cable networks represent more than 85 percent of residential broadband access in the US

- Fiber to the home (FTTH) provides higher speeds
- Direct fiber, connects one fiber leaving the CO for each home
	- Each fiber is shared my many homes
- Two optical distribution network architectures that perform splitting
	- Active optical networks (AONs)
		- Switched Ethernet
	- Passive optical networks (PONs)
		- Optical line signal connect to the Internet via a telco router
		- All packets send from OLT to the splitter are replicated at the splitter
- FTTH can provide Internet access rate in GB per sec
- Most FTTH ISPs are expensive
- In locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available, a satellite link is used
	- StarBand
	- HughesNet
- Dial-up access over traditional phone lies is based on the same model as DSL

_Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi_

- A local area network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router
- Ethernet is the most used
- Ethernet users use twisted-pairs copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch
- The Ethernet switch is connected into the larger Internet
- In a wireless LAN setting, wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from an access point that is connected into the network, which is wires to the Internet
- Wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11; called WiFi
- Home network consists of:
	- Base station (wireless access point)
	- Cable modem (broadband access to the Internet)
	- Router (interconnects the base station and PC with cable modem)

_Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE_

- Phones that use wireless infrastructure send/receive packets through a base station operated by a cellular network provider
- Third-generation (3G) wireless provides packet-switched wide-area wireless Internet at speed in excess of 1 Mbps
- 4G provides higher speeds
- LTE (Long-Term Evolution) uses 3G, but can achieve rates up to 10 Mbps


## Physical Media

- HFC uses a combination of fiber cable and coaxial cable
- DSL and Ethernet use copper wire
- Mobile access networks use the radio spectrum
- For each transmitter receiver pair, a bit is send by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a physical medium
	- Twister-pair copper wire
	- Coaxial cable
	- Multimode fiber-optic cable
	- Terrestrial radio spectrum
	- Satellite ratio
- Media types
	- Guided
		- Wires
	- Unguided
		- Waves
- The costs of the physical link is minor compared to networking costs
- Builders install twister pair, optical fiber, and coaxial cable in every room

_Twisted-Pair Copper Wire_
- The least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission medium
- 99% of wired connection are twisted-copper wire
- Two insulated copper wires, each about 1 mm thick, arranged in a regular spiral pattern
- The twisting reduced the electrical interference from similar pairs close by
- Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is used for computer networks within a building; LANs
- Data rates depend on thickness and distance between transmitter and receiver
- Most twisted-pair technology, 6a cable, can achieve data rates of 10 Gbps for distanced up to a hundred meters
- Twisted-pair has become dominant solution for high-speed LAN networking, over fibre-optics

_Coaxial cable_
- Consists of two copper conductors
- Concentric rather than parallel
- Common in television systems
- Transmitter shifts the digital signal to a specific frequency band, resulting analog signal is sent from the transmitter to one or more receivers
- Coaxial cable can be used as a guided shared medium

_Fiber Optics_
- Thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of light
- Immune to electromagnetic interference
- Low signal attenuation up to 100 km
- Preferred in long guided transmission medial
	- Oversea links
- High cost

_Terrestrial Radio Channels_
- Radio channels carry signals in electromagnetic spectrum
- No physical wire, can penetrate walls, used by mobile devices, and carry a signal for long distances
- Significantly reply on propagation environment
- Environmental factors
	- Path loss
	- Shadow fading (decreased the signal strength)
	- Multipath fading (signal reflections)
	- Interference (other transmissions or electromagnetic singals)
- 3 groups
	- Short distance (1-2 m)
		- Personal devices
	- Local areas (10-100 m)
		- Wireless LAN
	- Wide-area (> 10 km)
		- Cellular access

_Satellite Radio Channels_
- A communication satellite links two or more Earth-based microwave transmitter/receivers, known as grown stations
- Signals are regenerated using a repeater
- 2 types
	- Geostationary satellites
		- Remain at a permanent location
		- Signal propagation delay of 280 ms
		- Used in areas without access to DSL or cable-based Internet access
	- Low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites
		- Rotate around Earth
		- Communicate with each other, and ground stations
		- Used for Internet access in the future

# The Network Core
## Packet Switching

- End systems exchange messages with each other
- Source breaks long messaegs into smaller chucks called packets
- Each packet travels through communication links and packet switches
	- Routers
	- Link-layer switches
- Packets are transmitter at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link
- _L_ =
