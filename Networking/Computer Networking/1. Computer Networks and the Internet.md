# What Is the Internet?

## A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

- End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches
- Physical media
	- Coaxial cable
	- Copper wire
	- Optical fiber
	- Radio spectrum

- Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bit/second
- The data segments are known as a packet, and reassembled and the destination end systems
- A packet switch takes a packet arriving and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links
- Packet switches
	- Routers
		- Network core
	- Link-layer switches
		- Access networks
- The sequence of communication is a route or path
- End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- Each ISP network, is managed independently, and runs the IP protocol
- End systems, packet switches, and other pieces run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information
- Protocols
	- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
	- Internet Protocol (IP)
		- Specifies the format of the packets
- Protocols are known as TCP/IP
- Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- Standard documents are called request for comments (RFCs)
	- Define TCP, IP, HTTP, and SMTP
	- The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards

## A Service Description

- Application are distributed applications and involved multiple end systems that exchange data with each other
- Internet applications run on end systems
- Languages
	- Java
	- C
	- Python
- End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies how a program running on one end systems asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination

## What Is a Protocol?

- Hardware implemented protocols in two connected computers control the flow of bits
- Congestion control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver
- Protocols in routers determine a packet's path from source to destination

- A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event

# The Network Edge

- End systems
	- Computers
	- Servers
	- Mobile devices
- End systems are referred to as hosts because they host application programs
- Hosts
	- Clients
	- Servers
- Most servers reside in large data centres

## Access Networks

_Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite_

- Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable
- A residence obtains DSL internet from the telephone company (telco) that provides its wires local phone access
- Telco also provides an ISP
- Home DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to CO (central office), analog signals from houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM (digital subscriber line access multiplexer)

	- A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
	- A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
	- An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

- A splitter separates the data and telephone signals arriving to the home and forwards the data signal to the DSL modem
- On the telco side, in the CO, the DSLAM separate the data and phone signals and sends the data into the Internet
	- 12 Mbps downstream
	- 1.8 Mbps upstream
- Downstream and upstream rates are different; asymmetric
- Maximum rate is limited by the distance between the home and the CO
- DSL is designed for short distances
	- 5 to 10 miles of CO
- Cable Internet access makes use of cable television infrastructure
- Fiber optics connect the cable head end to neighbourhood-level junction, and coaxial cable is then used to reach individual homes
- The fiber and coaxial cable are called hybrid fiber coax (HFC)

- Cable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems
- Cable modem is an external device that connect the PC through an Ethernet port
- Cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network's DSLAM
	- Analog signal into digital format
- Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels
	- Downstream (higher transmission)
	- Upstream
- DOCSIS 2.0 standard
	- Downstream rates = 42.8 Mbps
	- Upstream rates = 30.7 Mbps

- Cable Internet access is a shared broadcast medium
- Every packet sent travels downstream on every link to every home, and upstream to the head end
- A distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions
- DSL and cable networks represent more than 85 percent of residential broadband access in the US

- Fiber to the home (FTTH) provides higher speeds
- Direct fiber, connects one fiber leaving the CO for each home
	- Each fiber is shared my many homes
- Two optical distribution network architectures that perform splitting
	- Active optical networks (AONs)
		- Switched Ethernet
	- Passive optical networks (PONs)
		- Optical line signal connect to the Internet via a telco router
		- All packets send from OLT to the splitter are replicated at the splitter
- FTTH can provide Internet access rate in GB per sec
- Most FTTH ISPs are expensive
