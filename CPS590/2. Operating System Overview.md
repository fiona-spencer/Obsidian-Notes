- OS have evolved from primitive batch systems to sophisticated multitasking, multiuser systems

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.1 - Operating System Objectives anf Functions</font>

---

- An OS is a program that controls the execution of application programs, and acts as an interface between application and the computer hardware

3 Objectives
1) Convenience
2) Efficiency
3) Ability to evolve

# The Operating System as a User/Computer Interface

- Hardware and software use in providing applications to user can be viewed in a layered fashion
- An application is expressed in a programming language
- A set of system programs are provides known as utilities/library programs
- These implement frequently used functions that assist in
	- Program creation
	- Management of files
	- Control of I/O devices
- OS masks the details of the hardware from the programmer, and provides a convenient interface

![[Pasted image 20250318200009.png|500]]

OS Areas:
1) Program development
	1) Editors/debuggers
2) Program execution
	1) Scheduling duties for loading data
3) Access to I/O devices
4) Controlled access to files
	1) From I/O device (disk drive, tape drive)
5) System access
	1) Protection against unauthorized users
6) Error detection and response
	1) Hardware error
	2) Software error
7) Accounting
	1) Monitor performance
8) Instruction set architecture (ISA)
9) Application binary interface (ABI)
10) Application programming interface (API)
	1) Access to hardware resources and systems through ISA with HLL library calls

# The Operating System as Resource Manager
- OS is responsible for controlling the use of a computer's resources
- 2 ways of controlling
	- Program or suit of programs
	- Relinquishes control
- A portion of the OS is in main memory
- This includes the kernel which contains the most frequently used function in the OS
- The remainder of main memory contains user and utility programs, and data
- OS decides controls access to and use of files

# Ease of Evolution of an Operating System

OS Evolution:
1. Hardware upgrade, new types of hardware
	1. Introduction of paging hardware
	2. Graphics terminal, windows
2. New Services
3. Fixes

- Systems should be modular in construction, with clearly defined interfaces between modules, and documentation
- Modularization may be harder for larger programs

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.2 - The Evolution of Operating Systems</font>

---
# Serial Processing
- Late 1950s to mid 1950s, the programer interacted with the computer hardware
- No IS
- Run from a console with display lights, toggle switches, input devices, and printer
- Programs in machine code were loaded using card readers
- 2 main problems
	- Scheduling
	- Setup time
- A single program, called a job
- This mode of operation is _serial processing_
- Linkers, loaders, debuggers, and I/O driver routines make processing more efficient

# Simple Batch Systems
- Wasted time was costly
- Batch OS was developed to refine processing
- A piece of software known as the monitor was used to branch back when a program was completed
	- Monitor point of view
		- Monitor is always in main memory and available for execution; resident monitor
		- Rest of the monitor is utilities and common function loaded as subroutines
		- The monitor executes the current job, when completed returns to monitor, and reads the next job
		- Output is send to printer
	- Processor point of view
		- Processor executed monitor
		- When encounters a job, it will branch to execute, the return to user program
- Monitor improved job setup time
- With each job, instructions are included in a primitive from of job control language (JCL)

```Fortran
$JOB
$FTN
.
. - instructions
.
$LOAD
$RUN
.
. - Data
.
$END
```

- Monitor reads the `$FTN`
- Loads language compiler, and translates user program into object code, then stores in memory
- Monitor loads the object and places into compiler, and executes
- If JCL line is invoked system will pass control to the monitor

Important Hardware Features:
- Memory protection
	- Detect an error in memory and transfer control to monitor
- Timer
	- Prevent a single job from monopolizing the system
	- Expiration
- Privileged instructions
	- Privileged instructions
- Interrupts
	- OS more control for user programs

- Modes of operations
	- User mode
	- Kernel mode

Downside of monitors (overhead)
- Main memory is used by monitors
- Processor time is consumed by the monitor

# Multiprogrammed Batch Systems

![[Pasted image 20250318203529.png|300]]![[Pasted image 20250318203751.png|300]]
![[Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 8.37.09 PM.png|400]]

- Program that processes a file, on average, uses 100 machine instructions per record
- The calculation shows the computer spends over 96% of its time waiting for I/O devices to finish transferring data to and from the file
- There is enough memory to hold the OS (resident monitor) and one user program
- Multiprogramming/multitasking is used in OS where multiple programs are loaded into memory and executed concurrently
	- CPU switches between programs

Ex.
- 250 Mbytes of memory
- Three jobs
- The average resource utilization, throughput, and response are shown

![[Pasted image 20250318204149.png|600]]

**Uni-programming**

Throughput = $3 jobs/30min=6 jobs/hr$
Mean response time = $(5+20+30)/3=18min$


**Multiprogramming**

Throughput = $3jobs/15min = 12jobs/hr$
Mean response time = $(5+15+10)/3 = 10min$


![[Pasted image 20250318204339.png]]

- A multiprogramming batch system must rely on certain computer hardware features
	- I/O interrupts and DMA
- Several jobs are kept in main memory, requiring memory management
- Processor must also decide which one to run, with an algorithm for scheduling

# Time-Sharing Systems
- Batch processing can be efficient
- For many application the user interacts directly with the computer
- To handle multiple interactive jobs, time sharing is used to share processor time among multiple users
- Multiple users simultaneously access the system through terminals, with the OS interleaving the execution of each user program in a short burst or quantum of computation
- $n$ users actively request service at one time, each user will see $1/n$ of the computer capacity, not counting OS overhead
- Time-Sharing System (CTSS), developed at MIT by Project MAC
- Time slicing uses each clock interrupt, so the OS regains control and assigns the processor to another use
- Old user programs and data are written out to disk before the new user programs are read in

![[Pasted image 20250318205757.png|500]]
![[Pasted image 20250318205816.png|500]]

- To minimize disk traffic, user memory was only written out when the incoming program would overwrite it
- The CTSS approach is primitive compared to present-day time sharing
- If multiple jobs are in memory, they must be protected from interfering with each other
- File systems must be protected to authorized users

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.3 - Major Achievements</font>

---

- OS are among the most complex pieces of software
- Development of OS
	- Processes
	- Memory management
	- Information protection and security
	- Scheduling and resource management
- These 4 areas span many key design and implementation issues of modern OS

# The Process
- More general than the term _job_
- Definitions of _process_
	- A program in execution
	- An instance of a program running on a computer
	- The entity that can be assigned to and executed on a processor
	- A unit of activity characterized by a single sequential thread of execution, a current state, and an associated set of system resources

- 3 major lines of OS development
	1) Multiprogramming batch operation
	2) Time-sharing
	3) Real-time transaction systems

Multiprogramming
- Key the processor, I/O devices, simultaneously busy to achieve maximum efficiency

Time-sharing
- Responsive to the needs of the individual user
- Support multiple users

Real-time transaction processing
- Multiple users entering queries or updates to a database

4 Main Causes of Errors
1. Improper synchronization
	1. Lost of duplicate signals
2. Failed mutual exclusion
	1. One routine at a time
3. Nondeterminate program operation
	1. Programs with shared memory
4. Deadlocks
	1) Both programs are waiting on each other

3 Components of a Process
1) An executable program
2) The associated data needed by the program
	1) Variables
	2) Work space
	3) Buffers
3) The execution context of the program

- The execution context, or process state, is the internal data by which the OS is able to supervise and control the process
- The context includes all the information the OS needs to manage the process
	- Program counter
	- Data registers
	- Priority of process
	- I/O events

![[Pasted image 20250319153028.png|400]]

- A and B, exist in portions of main memory
- Each process is recorded in a process list built and maintained by the OS
- The process list contains one entry for each process
	- Pointer to the location of the block of memory
	- Part or all the execution context of the process
- The remainder of the execution context is stored somewhere else
- Te base register is the starting address
- The limit is the size of the region (bytes or words)
- The process register indicated process B is executing
- OS can perform a process switch and resume the execution of process
- A switch consists of saving the context of B and restoring the context of A
- When the program counter is loaded with a value pointing into A's program area, process A resumes execution
- The process is realized at a data structure
- The process can either be executed or awaiting executing
- The entire state of the process at any instant is contained in its context
- New features can be designed and incorporated into the OS by expanding the context to include any number of examples where this process structure
- A thread is a single process which is assigned certain resources, and can be broken up into multiple, concurrent threads
- This provide a new level of parallel activity to be managed by hardware and software

# Memory Management
- Computer environment supports modular programming and flexible use of data
- System managers need efficient and orderly control of storage allocation

5 Principle storage management responsibilities:
1. Process isolcation
2. Automatic allocation and management
3. Support of modular programming
4. Protection and access control
5. Long-term storage

- OS meet these requirements with virtual memory and file system facilities
- The file system implements a long-term store, with information stores in named objects called files
- Virtual memory is a facility that allows programs to address memory from a logical point of view, without regard to the amount of main memory physically available
- Paging systems were introduced, which allows processes to be comprised of a number of fixed-size blocks, called pages
- A program references a word by means of a virtual address consisting of a page number ad an offset within the page
- The paging system provides a dynamic mapping between the virtual address and read address/physical address, in main memory
- All the pages of a process are maintained on disk
- Some of its pages are in main memory
- A page will be loaded into main memory when needed; virtual memory

![[Pasted image 20250319155302.png|400]]
![[Pasted image 20250319155335.png|400]]

- The processor hardware and OS, provides a "virtual processor"
- Memory may be a linear address space or a collection of segments, which are variable-length blocks of contiguous addresses
- Process isolation is achieved by giving each process a unique, non-overlapping virtual memory
- Memory sharing is achieved by overlapping portions of two virtual memory spaces
- Files are maintained in long-term store
- Files and portions of files may be copied into VM for manipulation
- Storage consists of directly addressable main memory, and lower-speed auxiliary memory
- Address translation hardware is interposed between the processor and memory
- Programs reference locations using virtual addresses, which are mapped into real main memory addresses
- OS designer needs to develop an address translation mechanism that generates litter overhead, and a storage allocation policy that minimizes the traffic between memory levels




# Information Protection and Security
- The growth of time-sharing systems, and computer networks has brought concern for protection of information

4 Categories of Security and Protection
1) Availability
2) Confidentiality
3) Data integrity
4) Authenticity

# Scheduling and Resource Management

3 Factors of Resource Management
1. Fairness
2. Differential responsiveness
3. Efficiency

- Scheduling and resource management are operations-research problems and the mathematical results
- The OS maintains a number of queues, with a list of processes waiting for some resources
- Short-term queue consists of processes that are in main memory
- _Round-robin_ is a technique that gives each process in the queue some time in turn
	- Circular queue
- Another strategy is to assign priority levels to the processes, with the schedular selecting processes in priority order
- Long-term queue is a list of new jobs waiting to use the processor
- The OS adds jobs by transferring processes from the long-term queue to the short-term queue
- Must of the research and development effort in OS has been directed at picking algorithms and data structures

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.4 - Developments Leading to Modern Operating Systems</font>

---

- Modern OS respond to new developments in hardware, new applications, and new security threats
- Increased processor speed, high-speed network attachments, and increasing size and variety of memory storage devices
- Multimedia applications, Internet and Web access, and client/server have influenced OS design

Categories of OS
- Microkernel architecture
- Multithreading
- Symmetric multiprocessing
- Distributed OS
- Object-oriented design

- Most OS featured large monolithic kernel
	- Scheduling
	- File system
	- Networking
	- Device drivers
	- Memory management
- A monolithic kernel is implemented as a single process, with all elements sharing the same address space
- A microkernel architecture assigns only a few essential functions to the kernel, including address space management, interprocess communication (IPC), and basic scheduling
- Other OS services, sometimes called servers, run in user mode and are treated like any other application
	- Decouples kernel and server development
- Microkernel interacts with local and remote server processes in the same way
	- Multithreading
		- A process, executing an application is divided into threads that can run concurrently
	- Thread
		- A dispatchable unit of work, that includes a processor context (PC and SP) and its own data area
	- Process
		- A collection of one or more threads
		- Associated system resources
- Multithreading is useful for applications that perform a number os essentially independent tasks that do not need to be serialized
	- Database server
- Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) is a term that refers to a computer hardware architecture

Advantages of SMP over Uniprocessor Architecture:
- Performance
- Availability
- Incremental growth
- Scaling

- OS must provides tools that functions to exploit the parallelism in an SMP system
- Multithreading and SMP are two independent facilities

![[Pasted image 20250319180526.png|400]]

- A distributed operating system provides the illusion of a single main memory space and a single secondary memory space, plus other unified access facilities
- Clusters are becoming increasing popular, and the state of the art for distributed OS lags behind that of uniprocessor and SMP OS
- Object-oriented design adds modular extensions to a small kernel


# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.5 - Fault Tolerance</font>

---

- Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system or component to continue normal operation despite the presence of hardware or software faults
	- Some degree of redundancy
	- Increases the reliability of the system
- Comes with a cost, either financially or performance wise

# Fundamental Concepts

3 Basic Measures
1. Reliability $R(t)$
2. Mean time to failure (MTTF)
3. Availability

- The reliability of a system is defined as the probability of its correct operation up to the time $t$ given that the system was operating correctly at time $t=0$
- The term correct operation means the correct execution of a set of programs, and the protection of data from unintended modification

- The mean time to failure is $MTTF = \int_{0}^{\infty} R(t) \,dt$

- the mean time to repair (MTTR) is the average time it takes to repair or replace a faulty element
- The availability of a system or service is defined as the fraction of time the system is available to service users' requests
- Downtime is the time in which the system is not available
- Uptime is the time in which the system is available

![[Pasted image 20250321103803.png|500]]

- The availability $A$ of a system is

![[Pasted image 20250321103941.png|300]]

![[Pasted image 20250321104024.png|500]]

- The MTTF is a better indicator than availability

# Faults
- The IEEE Standards Dictionary defined a fault an an erroneous hardware or software state resulting from component failure, operation error, physical interference, design error, program error, or data structure error
- Faults manifest
	- A defect in hardware
	- Incorrect step

Fault Categories
1) Permanent (ex. software bug, burnt-out component)
2) Temporary
	1) Transient (ex. bit transmission eror)
	2) Intermittent (ex. loose connection)

Methods of Redundancy
1. Spatial (physical) redundancy (ex. parallel circuitry, multiple components)
2. Temporal redundancy (ex. repeating functions)
3. Information redundancy (ex. RAID disks)

# Operating System Mechanisms

OS to Support Fault Tolerance
1) Process isolation
2) Concurrency control
3) Virtual machines
4) Checkpoints and rollbacks


# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.6 - OS Design Considerations for Multiprocessor and Multicore</font>

---

# Symmetric Multiprocessor OS Considerations
- In an SMP system, the kernel can execute on any processor, and typically each processor does self-scheduling from the pool of available processes or threads
- SMP shares resources
	- Kernel
	- Data structures
	- Accessing devices

- An SMP operating system manages processor and resources as a multiprogramming uniprocessor system

Key Design Issues:
1. Simultaneous concurrent processes or threads
2. Scheduling
3. Synchronization
4. Memory management
5. Reliability and fault tolerance

# Multicore OS Considerations
- The considerations for multicore systems include all the design issues discussed in the SMP system
- Current multicore vendors offer systems with ten or more cores on a single chip
- With the addition of a processor the number of cores and the amount of shared and dedicated cache memory increases
- The potential for parallelism exists at three levels in contemporary multicore system
	- Hardware within each core processor (instruction level)
	- Multiprogramming and multithreaded within each processor
	- Single application in concurrent processes or threads across multiple cores

*PARALLELISM WITHIN APPLICATIONS*
- Most applications can be subdivided into multiple tasks
- The compiler and the programming language features are used to support parallel design
- Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), implemented in the latest release of the UNIX-based MAX OS X and iOS
	- Multicore support capability
	- Thread pool mechanism
- Thread pools have been heavily used in server applications
- Anonymous function (blocks) are a way of specifying tasks
- GCD is not a major evolutionary step

*VIRTUAL MACHINE APPROACH*
- Dedicate a core to a particular process, to avoid overhead of task switching and scheduling decision
- Multiprogramming is based on the concept of a process, which is an abstraction of an execution environment
- OS requires protected space, free from user and program interface
- Kernel mode and user mode was developed

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.7 - Microsoft Windos Overview</font>

---

# Background
- MS-DOS was the first operating system on Windows in 1985
- Windows 10 incorporates features from the preceding desktop release
	- Supports desktops, laptops, smart phones, tablets, and Xbox

# Architecture
- Windows separates application-oriented software from the core OS software
- OS software includes Execution, the kernel, device drivers, and the hardware abstraction layer, runs in kernel mode
- Kernel-mode software has access to system data and to the hardware
- The remaining software, running in user mode, has limited access to system data

![[Pasted image 20250322144301.png|500]]

*OPERATING SYSTEM ORGANIZATION*
- Windows has a highly modular architecture
- Each system function is managed by one component of the OS
- Key syste, data can only be accessed through the appropriate function
- Modules can be removed, upgraded, or replaced without rewriting the entire system of APIs

Kernel-Mode Components if Windows:
1. Executive
2. Kernel
3. Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
4. Device drivers
5. Windowing and graphics system

Executive Modules:
1) I/O manager
2) Cache manager
3) Object manager
4) Plug-and-play manager
5) Power manager
6) Security reference monitor
7) Virtual memory manager
8) Process/thread manager
9) Configuration manager
10) Advanced local procedure call (ALPC) facility


*USER-MODE PROCESSES*

4 Basic Types of User-Mode Processes:
1. Special system processes
2. Service processes
3. Environment subsystems
4. User applications

- Windows support application for multiple OS users
- The process is started by the Windows Session Manager
- An environment subsystem provides a graphical or command-line user interface

# Client/Server Model
- Windows OS, environment subsystem, and applications are structured using client/server computing model
- The native NT API is a net of kernel-based services which provide the core abstractions used by the system
	- Porcesses
	- Threads
	- Virtual memory
	- I/O
	- Communication
- User-mode are implemented as processes that communicate with clients via RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
- Each server process wait for a request from a client for one of its serives
	- Memory services
	- Process creation
	- Services
	- Networking services
- The message is routed through the Executive to the appropriate server and returns the results of status information through another message back to the client

Advantage of a Client/Server Architecture:
1) Simplifies the Execution
2) Improves reliability
3) Provides a uniform means for application to communicate with services via RPCs without restricting flexibility
4) Provides a suitable base for distributed computing

# Threads and SMP

Features of Windows that Support Threads and SMP:
1) OS routines
2) Multiple threads of execution within a single processor
3) Server processes may use multiple threads to process requests from more than one client
4) Sharing data and resources between processes and flexible interprocess communication

# Windows Objects
- Windows is written in C
- Design uses concepts of object-oriented design

Key Object-Oriented Concepts in Windows:
1. Encapsulation
2. Object class and instance
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

- Objects are used in cases where data are intended for user-mode access, or when data access is shared or restricted
- Objects
	- Files
	- Processes
	- Threads
	- Semaphores
	- Timers
	- Graphical windows
- Windows creates and manages objects via the object manager
- Each object within the Executive, referred to as a kernel object, exists as a memory block allocated by the kernel and is accessible only by kernel-mode components
	- Common object types
		- Object name
		- Security parameters
		- Usage count
	- Specific object types
		- Thread priority
- Applications manipulate objects indirectly through the set of object manipulation function supported by the Executive
- Objects may have security information associated with them, in the form of a Security Descriptor (SD)
- In Windows, objects may be either named or unnamed
- Handles can be inherited by child processes or duplicated between processes

2 Categories of Objects Used by Windows for Synchronizing
1) Dispatcher objects
2) Control objects

- Data structures that reside completely within one Executive component are not represented as objects

![[Pasted image 20250322150718.png]]

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.8 - Traditional UNIX Systems</font>

---
# History
- UNIX was initially developed at Bell Labs and became operation on a PDP-7 in 1970
- UNIX was translated to C from assembly language
- C implementation demonstrated the advantages of using a high-level language

# Description
- The classic UNIX architecture can be pictures in 3 levels
	- Hardware
	- Kernel
	- User
- The OS is often called the system kernel, and interacts directly with the hardware
- The shell contains multiple user services and interfaces that support system calls form applications, other interface software, and the components of the C compiler
	- Compiler
	- Assembler
	- Loader
- User programs can invoke OS services either directly, or through library programs
- The system call interface is the boundary with the user and allows higher-level software to gain access to specific kernel function

2 Main Parts of UNIX Systems:
1. Process control
2. File management and I/O

- For block-oriented transfers, a disk cache approach is used
	- A system buffer in memory is interposed between the user address space and the external derives
- *Traditional UNIX systems* is referred to System V Release 3 (SVR3), 4.3BSD, and earlier versions
	- Runs on a single processor
	- Lacks the ability to protect its data structures from concurrent access by multiple processors
	- Kernel is not versatile
	- Supports a single type of file system
	- Process scheduling policy
	- Executable file formate


![[Pasted image 20250322165355.png|400]]

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.9 - Modern UNIX Systems</font>

---

- UNIX added other modern OS design features, and produced a more modular architecture
- A typical modern UNIX kernel is a small core of facilities, written in a modular fashion, that provide functions and services needed by OS processors
- Each circle represents functions and an interface that may be implemented in a variety of ways

![[Pasted image 20250322165617.png|400]]

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 2.10 - Linux</font>

---
# History
- Linux started out as a UNIX variant for IBM PC architecture
- Written by Linus Torvalds in 1991
- Today, Linux is a full-featured UNIX system that runs no virtually all platforms
- Linux uses free software packages under the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
	- Goal is stable, platform-independent software that is free
- FSF's GNU project provides tools for software developers, and the GNU Public License (GPL) is the seal of approval

# Modular Structure
- Most UNIX kernels are monolithic
	- Single process with a single address space
- All functional components of the kernel have access to all of its internal data structures and routines
- If changes are made to the OS, all the modules and routines must be relinked, reinstalled, and reboots
- Loadable modules are independent blocks that can be loaded and unloaded on demand
- Linux may be considered monolithic, its modular structure overcomes some of the challenges

Loadable Module Characteristics:
1) Dynamic linking
2) Stackable modules
	1) Reduced replications
	2) Loads required modules when needed

- Dynamic linking facilitates configurations and saves kernel memory
- A user can load and unload kernel modules using `insmod`, `modprobe`, and `rmmod` commands

Two modules loaded:
1. FAT and VFAT

- Each module is defined by two tables
	- Module table
		- `*name, refnt, num_syms, *syms`
	- System table
		- Lists symbols that are defined in this module and used elsewhere


![[Pasted image 20250322171655.png|500]]

# Kernel Components

- Each box indicates a separate process
- Squiggly line represents a thread of execution
- The kernel consists of an interacting collection of components

Principle Linux Kernel Components
1) Signals

_SYSTEM LIBRARIES_
- Layer below the Application Framework
- Two parts
	- System Libraries (C/C++)
	- Android Runtime

Key System Libraries
1) Surface Manager
2) OpenGL
3) Media Framework
4) SQL Database
5) Browser Engine
6) Bionic LibC

*LINUX KERNEL*
- Android kernel lacks drivers not applicable in mobile environments, making the kernel smaller
- Enhances features that are tailored to the mobile environment

# Android Runtime
- iOS and Windows use software that is compiled directly to the specific hardware platform
- Most Android software is mapped into a bytecode format, which it ten transformed into native instructions on the device itself
- Earlier releases of Android used a scheme known as Dalvik
- More recent releases use Android runtime (ART)

_THE DALVIK VIRTUAL MACHINE_
- Executes files in the .dex format
- Optimized for efficient storage and memory-mappable execution
- The VM can run classes complied by a Java language compiler
- Each Android application runs in its own process

_THE DEX FILE FORMAT_
- The DVM runs applications and code written in Java
- A standard Java compiler turns source code into bytecode
- Bytecode is then compiled into a .dex file

_ANDROID RUNTIME CONCEPT_
- Designed for a single core and low-memory devices
- More recently, multicore processors and more memory
- Applications in Java compiled to dex bytecode
- ART executes dex bytecode but instead of compiling the bytecode at runtime, compiles to native machine code during install time of the app
- This is called ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation
- APK, an application package that comes form the developer to the user
- Cycle begins with the source code being compiled into a .dex format to form a APK
- When installed directly into the application directory, the Dalvik and ART processes
- `dexopt` optimized the dex code referred to as quickened dex
- In ART, `dex2oat` function does the same
- The output is an Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file, which funs directly without an interpreter

_ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES

Benefits of ART:
1. Reduces startup time of applications
2. Improves battery life
3. Lesser RAM footprint
4. Many Garbage Collection optimizations and debug enhancements

Disadvantages of ART:
1. Application installation takes more time
2. First boot is longer
3. Native code requires more internal storage space

# Android System Architecture

Android Layers:
1) Applications and Framework
2) Binder IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
3) Android System Services
4) Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
5) Linux Kernel

# Activities
- An activity is a single visual user interface components
	- Menu selections
	- Icons
	- Checkboxes
- Every screen in an application is an extension of the Activity class

# Power Management

- Two features in Linux Kernel for power management:
	- Alarms
	- Wakelocks
- The Alarms can request a timed wake-up service
	- Triggers even if system is in sleep
- Wakelocks prevents Android system from entering into sleep mode

An Application can hold one of the following Wakelocks:
1. Full_Wake_Lock
2. Partial_Wake_Lock
3. Screen_Dim_Wake_Lock
4. Screen_Bright_Wake_Lock

- These locks are requested through the API
