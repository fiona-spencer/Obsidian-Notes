- All multiprogramming OS are built around the concept of the process
- Processes
	- OS must interleave the execution of multiple processes
	- OS must allocate resource to processes
	- OS may be required to support interprocess communication and user creation of processes


# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 3.1 - What is a Process?</font>

# Background
- A computer platform consists of a collection of hardware resources
	- Processor
	- Main memory
	- I/O modules
	- Timers
	- Disk drivers
- Computer applications are developed to perform some task
- Inefficient to write for a specific hardware
- OS was developed to provide convenient, feature-rich, secure, and consistent interface for applications to use
- OS is an abstract representation of resources
	- Main memory
	- Network interfaces
	- File systems

Manage the Execution of Appilcations
- Resources are made available to multiple applications
- Physical processor is used for multiple applications
- Processor and I/O devices can be used efficiently

# Processes and Process Control Blocks
- Process
	- A program in execution
	- An instance of a program running on a computer
	- The entity that can be assigned to and executed on a processor
	- A unit of activity characterized by the execution of a sequence of instructions, a current state, and an associated set of system resources

2 Essential Elements of a Process:
1) Program code
2) Set of data

Other Elements:
1. Identifier
2. State
3. Priority
4. Program counter
5. Memory pointers
6. Context data
7. I/O status information
8. Accounting information

- The information in the preceding list is stored in a data structure, called a process control block
- When a process is interrupted, the current values of the program counter and processor register (context data) are saved in the appropriate fields of the corresponding process control block, and the state of the process is changed to some other value, such as _blocked or ready_
- The program counter and context data for this process are loaded into the processor register, and this process now begins to execute


![[Pasted image 20250323113303.png|300]]

- A process consists of:
	- Program code
	- Associated data
	- Process control block

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 3.2 - Process States</font>

---

- For a program to be executed, a process, or task, is created for that program
- A listing of a process is referred to as a trace of the process
- Three programs are fully loaded in main memory
- A dispatcher program switches the processor from one process to another

![[Pasted image 20250323123735.png|300]]![[Pasted image 20250323123748.png|320]]

- The figure below shoes the traces from the processor's point of view
- Interleaved traces resulting form the first 52 instruction cycles
- The shaded code represents code executed by the dispatcher
- OS only allows a process to continue execution for a maximum of six instruction cycles

![[Pasted image 20250323124106.png|500]]

# A Two-State Process Model

- OS principal responsibility is controlling the execution of processes
	- Interleaving pattern for execution
	- Allocating resources to processes
- A process has two states:
	- Running
	- Not running

![[Pasted image 20250324083506.png|400]]

- The processes are in a queue
- Or consists of a linked list of data blocks, in which each block represents one process
- If the process has completed or aborted, it is discarded

# The Creation and Termination of Processes
- A process is bounded by its creation and termination


_PROCESS CREATION_
- OS builds the data structures used to manage the process, and allocates address space in main memory
- Four levels of process creation
	1) New batch job
	2) Interactive log-on
	3) Created by OS to provide a service
	4) Spawned by existing process

![[Pasted image 20250324084050.png|500]]

- When an OS creates a process at the explicit request of another process, the action is referred to as process spawning
- The former process is referred to as the parent process
- And the spawned process is referred to as the child process

_PROCESS TERMINATION_
- A batch job should includes a Halt instruction
- The action will indicate when the process is complete on OS processes
- Errors and fault conditions can lead to the termination of a process
- A process may be terminated by the process that created it, or when the parent process is itself terminated

![[Pasted image 20250324084439.png|500]]

# A Five-State Model
- The queue is a FIFO list and the processor operated in round-robin
- Using a single queue, the dispatcher would have to scan the list looking for the process that is not blocked and that has been in the queue the longest
- Another way is to split the Not Running state into two:
	- Ready
	- Blocked

5 States:
1. Running
2. Read
3. Blocked/Waiting
4. New
5. Exit

![[Pasted image 20250324084714.png|400]]

- OS may limit the number of processes that may be in the system for reasons of performance or main memory limitations
- A process exits a system in two stages
	- Process is terminated
	- Termination moves the process to Exit state
- The tables and other information associated with the job are temporarily preserved by the OS

Possible Transitions:
1) Null --> New
2) New --> Ready
3) Ready --> Running
4) Running --> Exit
5) Running -> Ready
6) Running --> Blocked
7) Blocked --> Ready
8) Ready --> Exit
9) Blocked --> Exit

- More efficient to have number of queues, one for each event
- Compared to the entire list of processes searching the entire block queue

![[Pasted image 20250324085343.png|500]]

- If the dispatching of processes is dictated by a priority scheme, then is would be convenient to have a number of Ready queues, one for each priority level


# Suspended Processes

_THE NEED FOR SWAPPING_

- In the three state system each process must loaded fully into main memory to be executed
- Process is much faster than I/O, and will be waiting in I/O (idle)
- Swapping moves part or all of a process from main memory to disk
- The Suspend state is added to perform swapping (transferring to disk)
- Two choices to bring into main memory
	- Admit a newly created process
	- Bring in previously suspended process

4 States:
1) Ready
2) Blocked
3) Blocked/Suspend
4) Ready/Suspend

![[Pasted image 20250324085945.png|400]]

- The use of virtual memory would appear to eliminate the need for explicit swapping, because any desired address in any desired process can be moved in or out of main memory

Important New Transition:
1) Blocked --> Blocked/Suspend
2) Blocked/Suspend --> Ready/Suspend
3) Ready/Suspend --> Ready
4) Ready --> Ready/Suspend
5) New --> Ready/Suspend and New --> Ready
6) Blocked/Suspend --> Blocked
7) Running --> Ready/Suspend
8) Any State --> Exit


_OTHER USES OF SUSPENSION_
- A process that is not in main memory is not immediately available for execution, whether or not it is awaiting an event

Characteristics of a Suspended Process:
1) The process is not immediately available for execution
2) The process may or may not waiting on an event
3) The process was placed in a suspended state by an agent
4) The process may not be removed from this states until the agent explicitly orders the removal

Reasons to Suspend:
- Need memory space
- Auditing or tracing process may be employed to monitor activity
- Record the level of utilization
- Rate of progress of the user processes

# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 3.3 - Process Description</font>

---

- There are a number of processes $(P_1, ..., P_n)$ in virtual memory
- $P_1$ is running
- $P_2$ is in main memory, but is blocked waiting for an I/O device
- $P_n$ has been swapped out and is suspended

![[Pasted image 20250324093955.png|500]]

# Operating System Control Structures
- The OS constructs and maintains tables of information about each entity that it is managing
- Four different types of tables maintained by OS
	- Memory
	- I/O
	- File
	- Process
- Memory tables are used to keep track of both main (real) and secondary (virtual) memory
- Processes are maintained on secondary memory using VM or simple swapping mechanism
- Memory tables include:
	- The allocation of main memory to processes
	- The allocation of secondary memory to processes
	- Any protection attributes of blocked of main or virtual memory
	- Any information needed to manage virtual memory
- I/O tables are used by the OS to manage the I/O device and channels of the computer system
- File tables provide information about the existence of files, their location on secondary memory, their current status, and other attributes
- All four distinct sets of tables are linked or cross-referenced
- Memory, I/O, and files are managed by the processor

# Process Control Structures
- OS need process location, attributes for its management (process ID and state)

_PROCESS LOCATION_
- A process must include a program or set of programs to be executed
- Associated with these programs is a set of data locations for local and global variables and any defined constants
- Execution of a program involved s stack that is used to keep track of procedure called and parameter passing
- Collection of attributes is the _process control block_
- The process image:
	- Collection of programs
	- Data
	- Stack
	- Attributes

![[Pasted image 20250324094901.png|500]]

- The location of process image will depend on the memory management scheme being used
- The process image is maintained as contiguous block of memory
- With CTSS, when a process is swapped out, part of the process image may remain in main memory
- OS keeps track of which portions of the image of each process are still in main memory
- Modern OS presume paging hardware that allows non-contiguous physical memory to support partially resident processes
- There is a primary process table with one entry for each processes
- Each entry contains as least, a pointer to a process image

_PROCESS ATTRIBUTES_
- Process attributes reside in a process control block

3 General Categories of the Process Control Block:
1) Process identification
2) Processor state information
3) Process control information

- Each process is assigned a unique numeric identifier, which may simply be an index into the primary process table
- Memory tables may be organized to provide a map of main memory with indication of which process is assigned to each region
- When processes create other processes, identifiers indicates the parents and descendants
- Process state information is the contents of processor register
- When interrupted, all of the register information is saved to be restores
- Registers will include user visible register, control and status register, and stack pointer
- Program status word (PSW) contains status information is used to condition code
	- EFLAGS
- Process control information is the additional information needed to control active processes

![[Pasted image 20250324095528.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250324095548.png|500]]
![[Pasted image 20250324095607.png]]

- Below is the structure of process image in virtual memory
	- Control block
	- User stack
	- Private address space of the process
	- Any other address space shared
- Each process image appears as a contiguous range of addresses
- In an actual implementation this is not the case
- Pointers allow the linking of process control blocks

![[Pasted image 20250324100926.png|400]]


_THE ROLE OF THE PROCESS CONTROL BLOCK_
- The process control block is the most important data structure in an OS
- Each control block contains all of the information about a process that is needed by the OS
- The blocks are read and modified by virtually every module in the OS
- Routines will need access to information in this control block
- Each process has a unique ID, and can be used as an index into a table of pointers to process control blocks

2 Problems
1) A bug in a single routine, can damage process control blocks
2) Design in the structure or semantics can affect moduels

- The problems can be addressed by requiring all routined in the OS to go through a handler routine

# Modes of Execution
- Most processors support at least two modes of execution
	- User
	- Kernel
- To protect the OS and key OS tables, the kernel mode is the only process to control registers, and memory
- Most OS, such as Linux, use Level 0 for kernel and another level for user

![[Pasted image 20250324101503.png|500]]

# Process Creating
- To create a new process:
	1) Assign a unique process identifier to the new rpocess
	2) Allocate space for the process
	3) Initialize the process control block
	4) Set the appropriate linkages
	5) Create or expand other data structures

# Process Switching
- Process switching is when a running process is interrupted, and the OS assigned another process to the Running state and turns control over


_WHEN TO SWITCH PROCESSES_
- Two kinds of system interrupts
	- Interrupt (external)
	- Trap (internal)
- With an ordinary interrupt, control is first transferred to an interrupt handler, which does basic housekeeping
	- Clock interrupt
		- Time slice is the maximum amount of time that a process can execute before being interrupted
	- I/O interrupt
	- Memory fault
- A trap occurs when a program encounters an error or a special condition requiring OS intervention
- OS may be activated by a supervisor call from the program begin executed

![[Pasted image 20250324101931.png]]

_MODE SWITCHING_
- If an interrupt is pending the processor
	- Sets the program counter to the starting address of an interrupt-handler program
	- It switches from user mode to kernel mode

- Context must include any information that may be altered by the execution of the interrupt handler
- Typically, the saving and restoring functions are performed in hardware


_CHANGE OF PROCESS STATE_
- Mode switch is a concept distinct from that of the process switch
- A mode switch may occur without changing the state of the process that is currently in the Running State

Process Switch
1) Save the context
2) Update the process control block
3) Move the process control block to appropriate queue
4) Select another process for execution
5) Update the process control block of the processes selected
6) Update memory management data structures
7) Restore the context of the processes

- A process switch, involves a state change, required more effort than a mode switch


# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 3.5 - Execution of the Operating System</font>

---

- OS functions in the same way as ordinary computer software
- OS relinquishes control and depends on the processor to restore control

# Nonprocess Kernel
- Common in older OS, the kernel is outside of any process
- Currently running processes are interrupted or issued a supervisor call, the mode context of this process is saved and control is passed to the kernel
- OS has its own memory and system stack
- Process applies only to user programs
- Operating system code is executed as a separate entity that operates in privileged mode

# Execution within User Processes

![[Pasted image 20250324104731.png|400]]

- PCs execute virtually all OS software in the context of user process
- OS is a collections of routines the user called to perform various function
- Each image includes not only the regions of a normal process, but also program, data, and stack areas for kernel programs
- A separate kernel stack is used to manage calls/returns while the process is in kernel mode

![[Pasted image 20250324104947.png|200]]

- Operating system code and data are in the shared address space and shared by all user processes
- When an interrupt, trap, or supervisor call occurs, the processor is placed in kernel mode and passed to the OS
- The mode context is saved before the mode switch
- A user program has been interrupted to employ some OS routine, then resumes, and avoids two process switches
- Although it control is passed to a process-switching routine, it will still have to use process switching
- User cannot tamper with the OS routines

# Process-Based Operating System
- OS is a collection of system processes
- Major kernel functions are organized as separate processes
- There may be a small amount of process-switching code that is executed outside of any process
- Encourage the use of a module OS with minimal, clean interfaces between modules
- Noncritial OS functions are implemented as separate processes


# <font style="color:#96DED1"> 3.6 - UNIX SVR 4 Process Management</font>

---
- UNIX System V makes use of model in 3.15 b, OS executes within the user process
- UNIX uses two categories of processes
	- System processes
	- User processes
- A user process enters kernel mode by issuing a system call, when a exception (fault) is generated, or when an interrupt occurs

# Process States
- 9 process states are recognized by the UNIX SVR4 OS
	- UNIX employs two Running states (user/kernel)
	- Ready to run in memory and preempted are separated

![[Pasted image 20250324105913.png|600]]
![[Pasted image 20250324105936.png|400]]

- Preemption can only occur when a process is about to move form kernel mode to user mode
- Process 0 is a special process that is created when the system boots
- Process 0 spawn process 1, referred to as the init processes
- When a new interactive user logs on, process 1 creates user process
- The user processes creates branching tress, such as applications

# Process Description
- 3 parts of process image
	- User-level context
	- Register context
	- System-level context

# Process Control
- Process creation in UNIX
	- `fork()`
		- Allocates a slot in the process table for the new process
		- Assigns a unique ID to the child process
		- Makes a copy of the process image of the parent. which the exception of any shared memory
		- Increments counters fro any files owned by the parent
		- Assigned the child process to the Ready to Run state
		- Returns the ID number of the child to the parent process, and a 0 value to the child process

- All of this is in the kernel mode in the parent process
	- Stay in parent process
	- Transfer control to the child process
	- Transfer control to another processes

- If the value is nonzero, then the parent process, and main line of execution can continue
