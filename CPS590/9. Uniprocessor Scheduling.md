- In multiprogramming system, multiple processes exist concurrently in main memory
- Each process alternates between using a processor and waiting for some event to occur, such as the completion of an I/O operation
- The processors are kept busy by executing one process while the other processes wait
- The key to this is scheduling
- 4 types of scheduling are used
- Long-term scheduling and medium-term scheduling are driven by performance concerns related to the degree of multiprogramming

- The aim of processor scheduling is to assign processes to be executed by the processor over time, in a way that meets system objectives, such as response time, throughput, and processor efficiency
- In many systems, this is separated into 3 functions
	- Long-term
	- Medium-term
	- Short-term

- Long-term scheduling is performed when a new process is created
- Medium-term is a part of the swapping function
- Short-term is the actual decision of which ready process to execute next
- Below reorganizes the state transition diagram to suggest nesting of scheduling functions

- Scheduling affects the performance of system because it determines which process will wait, and which will proceed

# Long-Term Scheduling
- The long-term scheduler determines which program are admitted to the system for processing
- Is controls the degree of multiprogramming
- Once admitted, a job becomes a process and is added to the queue for the short-term
- In some systems, a created process begins in a swapped-out condition, in which it is added to a queue for the medium scheduler
- In a batch system, the newly submitted job is routed to disk and held in a batch queue
- The long-term scheduler creates processes from the queue when it can
- The more processes created, the smaller the percentage of time for each processes
- The long-term scheduler limits the degree of multiprogramming
- Each time a job terminates, the scheduler decides to add one or more new jobs
- The decision comes from first-come first-serve (FCFS) basis
- Based on
	- Priority
	- Expected execution time
	- I/O requirements

# Medium-Term Scheduling
- Medium-term scheduling is part of the swapping function
- Swapping-in decision will consider the memory requirements of the swapped-out processes


# Short-Term Scheduling
- The long-term scheduler executes relatively infrequently compares to short-term
- The short-term is also known as the dispatcher, executes more frequently and make the fine-grained decision of which process to execute next
- Invoked when an event occurs that may lead to the blocking of the current process, or that may provide an opportunity to preemt the blocking of the current process
	- Clock interrupts
	- I/O interrupts
	- Operating system calls
	- Signals (semaphores)
