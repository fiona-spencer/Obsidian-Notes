# Direct Memory Access (DMA)

- Performed by a separate module on the system bus
- When data needs to be transferred to or from main memory

CPU issues command to DMA module indicating:
- Address of I/O device
- Reading or writing
- Address in memory to read/write
- Amount of words

- DMA module handles data transfer
	- Part of system bus architecture, not part of CPU
- Processor is free to do other things in the meantime
- DMA module issues interrupt when transfer is complete
- Transfers the entire block of data directly to and from memory without going through the processor
- Process is only involved at the beginning and the end of the transfer
- When the DMA module is finished, it sends an interrupt to the processor
- Drawback: Processor may execute more slowly during a transfer it is requires access to the system bus

Drawback
- If the CPU needs the bus, and it is in use by the DMA module, the CPU must wait one bus cycle
- Time to transfer one word along the bus
- The processor waits, and might wait often if DMA module is moving a large chunk of data
- Still more efficient than programmed or interrupt-driven I/O

Cycle-Stealing DMA
- DMA module holds the bus for one word transfer, then relinquishes the bus
- Request bus control for next word, transfer, give up bus, etc
- Prevents DMA from tying up the bus
- Steals cycles when it can

# CPU Cycle vs Bus Cycle

- Bus speed ranges from 66-800 MHz
- DMA has little effect on CPU
- If CPU is fetching from cache, it does not need bus to access main memory
- DMA does not saturate BUS because I/O devices are slow

# Common I/O Interfaces

- I/O devices use a simple memory mapped I/O scheme
- I/O devices use their own idiosyncrasies and protocols

Most common I/O devices use standardized protocols:
1) SATA - Serial ATA
	1) Serial Advanced Technology Attachment
2) USB
	1) Universal Serial Bus
3) PCI, PCI-express
	1) Peripheral Component Interconnect
4) VGA, DVI, HDMI
	1) Video Graphics Array, Digital Visual Interface, High-Def Multimedia Interface


# System Bus Architecture

- ARC system bus is 32 bits wide
- Data bus is 32-bit
	- Load a full word in a single instruction cycle
	- Bits are places on bus in parallel
- Address but is 32-bits
	- Every instruction is 32-bits, placed in parallel on address bus


# Parallel Ports

- Common features on older systems
	- Older printers
	- Transferred data in parallel
- Parallel communication comes with many problems
	- Increased cable size, cost-per-foot, power consumption
	- Timing is also trickier

# Serial Bus Architectures

- Serial (one bit at a time) has serious advantages over parallel communication
- At distances of a few feet, serial communication is more economical
- Depends on bit-rate: serial interconnects need higher bit-rate to compensate for lack of parallelism

Physical/Economical Cost:
- Serial cables can be thinner, cheaper
- Physically take up less space
- Consume less power, driving fewer data pins
- Timing is more manageable

- Parallel interconnects are used _inside_ the computer, and serial interconnects are used _outside_ the computer

Inside the Computer:
- System Bus, PCI devices
- Devices connected straight to the motherboard

Outside the computer:
- USB device have cords between 3-6 feet
- SATA hard drives are internal, but cable from drive to motherboard can be 12-18 inches

# Recommended Standard-232: RS-232

- Before USB, we had RS-232
- Common for low-bit-rate devices
	- Mice
	- Keyboard
- Common for embedded systems
- Boards have onboard USB to serial chips
- Common in industrial applications
	- PLCs
	- VFDs

# RS-232: Pin-Out

- RXD: Pin over which data is received
- TXD Pin over which data is sent
- The must be crossed between male and female ends of the connection
- Also mean we can send and receive data at the same time
- Other pins are for various handshaking and control functions


# USB: Universal Serial Bus

- In modern PC systems, RS-232 has been replaced by USB
	- USB Type-B connector
	- Micro-USB (android charger)
	- USB Type-A connector
	- USB-C connector (reversible)
- USB devices are _plug-and-play_, meaning the do not need to reboot every time a new device is plugged in
- USB defines a common communication standard used by a wide variety of peripherals
- Keyboards, mice, printers, mass storage devices, WIFI and Bluetooth dongles
- USB became USB 2.0, and then USB 3.0
- 12 Mbps, 480 Mbps, 5Gbps, respectively
- USB 3.2, can achieve up to 20 Gbps when using USB-C
- USB devices are managed by a host controller


# USB: Host Controller
- USB 3.x - eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI)
- xHCI is a computer interface specification for a USB host controlled
- This host controller is part of a motherboard's chipset
- HCI handles power distribution to devices, communication, etc
- Software device drivers, often provide by the OS, talk to the HCI
- USB HCI can also be included via peripheral card (PCI) add on

# USB Device to Memory

- From a USB peripheral, connects to HCI
- HCI identifies, manages, provides power
- Device driver (software) talks to HCI
- Gets data from HCT, store in memory
- In an HLL, we get data into out program via a system call
- A statement like `scanf` invokes an underlaying OS-specific system call
- This call will use device driver to get the keystroke from the HCI

- In assembly, we `call` specific system subroutines
	- `call scanf, call printf`
- Push arguments onto stack

- In modern systems, the OS maintains software buffers for I/O devices
- When we need a keystroke, OS supplies it from such a buffer
- Devices themselves might have internal buffers as well
- Older keyboards can only handle a small number of key being pressed at once

# Keyboards

- Modern keyboards have their own processor (microcontroller)
- They key matrix is a grid of contacts underneath the keys
- Keypresses close a circuit in the matrix
- Each key represents a specific character, indicated by the keyboard's onboard character map
- The state of the key matrix indicates which keys are pressed
- The keyboard's micro-controller analyzes the state of the key matrix
- Instead of discrete IC, embed the chip directly into the PCB
- The state of the key matrix is translated into a character using onboard character map
- Characters are placed into onboard buffer
- They are then sent to computer via USB connection according to USB standard
- HCI receives keyboard data, OS talks to HCI
- Passes data on to active application
- Application accepts keystrokes as content or ignores

# USB: Summary

- Standardized protocol used by many peripherals
- USB devices managed by an HCI (Host Controller Interface), which is also standardized
- **xHCI** is one HCI standard
- Device drivers provided by OS know how to talk to HCT
- Both HLL and assembly, make system calls to subroutines implemented in the device drivers

# Serial ATA

- SATA is the interface
- Can connect HDDs, SSDs, or optical drives
- Parallel ATA preceded serial ATA
- PATA is commonly referred to as IDA (Integrated Drive Electronics)
- SATA devices are hot-swappable, part of the SATA standard
- Can add/remove SATA devices without powering down the system
- Requires OS to support

# SATA: Host Controller Interface

AHCI: Advanced Host Controller Interface
- Devices can implement an existing standard
	- USB 2.0/3.0, PCIe, SATA, eSATA, VGA, DVI, HDMI, etc.
	- Different styles will make more or less sense for different devices
	- Mass storage devices commonly use SATA, USB, NVMe (SSDs)
- Like USB, AHCI is commonly part of motherboard chipset
- Can be added via PCIe card, or chip on motherboard

# South Bridge

- Bridges are chips on the motherboard that manage and connect the various buses
- Motherboard is designed for the chipset
- Encompasses bridges and other thigns
- Chipset must be compatible with CPU
- North bridge does not exist anymore
- Its functions are incorporated into modern CPUs directly

# Bridge-Based Bus Architecture

- Every part of the computer system is connected via some sort of bus
- Those buses are joined and managed by bridges
- Bridges handle timing and communication

1. North bridge incorporated into CPU
2. AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) does not exist anymore, replace by PCIe
3. Firewire is more or less obsolete, replaced by USB 3.0, SATA
4. IDE (PATA) replaced by SATA
5. ISA only really used for specialized industry purposes

# PCIe: Peripheral Component Interconnect express

- Most commonly used to connect _Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)_
- GPUs can drive multiple displays, perform highly parallel graphics rendering
- PCI components also include sound cards, network interfaces cards (NICs)
- Now, these are integrated into motherboard/chipset
- Also USB/SATA expansion cards

# GPU: Graphic Processing Unit

- Draws thousands of polygons
- Modern monitors can refresh at up to 240Hz
- CPU cannot keep up with this in addition to everything else
	- Processing keyboard and mouse input
- CPU is a specialized component meant for graphics rendering

NVIDIA 4090:
- 16384 cores, 2520 MHz
- Each CPU core is less capable then a CPU's
- Graphics rendering involves millions of simple, highly parallelizable operations
- GPU ISA is different from CPU
- GPU's are not used for general-purpose computing
- Not exposes to programmer
- Program for CPU using CUDA/OpenG/DirectX
- Integrated graphics (built into MoBo/chipset) is good enough for low intensity graphic use
- Just like integrated sound/NIC


# Common I/O Interfaces

- Mouse
- Touch sensitive pen-base display
- Joystick
- Laser printer
- Cathode ray tube

# Multiprocessing

- The speed of the program is limited by the speed at which we can perform the fetch execute cycle
- Improve this through pipelining
- Start next instruction before current instruction has finished
- Higher clock speed (overclocking) = higher power requirement, more heat generated
- The heat must be dissipated, or the CPU melts

Amdahl's Law States:
speedup = time to execute on single processor/time to execute on p parallel processors

$$speedup = \frac{1}{f+\frac{1-f}{p}}$$
- $f$ refers to the fraction of code that must be performed sequentially
- Even small values of $f$ causes speed up to plateau quickly

$S = \frac{1}{0.1 + \frac{0.9}{10}} = 5.3$

$S = \frac{1}{0.1 + \frac{0.9}{\infty}} = 10$

- Performance tends to peak between 4-6 cores
- Certain database application and data management systems can achieve near perfect scaling
- Great care is placed on reducing the proportion of serial code


# Computer Vision

- Involved performing a series of simple operations on individual pixels, or small groupings of pixels
- Each pixel can be processed independently on the others
- Millions of pixels in a typical HD image
- Modern GPUs have thousands of core
- Each less capable than a typical CPU core, but far more of them
- Great for performing thousands of simple operations simultaneously
- Can speed up image processing by orders of magnitude
