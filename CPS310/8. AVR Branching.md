# Example: Binary Counter

```
Rd <- K

LDI Rd, K

1110 KKKK dddd KKKK
```

OUT - Store Register to I/O Location
- Stores data from register Rr in the Register File to I/O Space (Ports, Timers, Configuration Register)

void setup(){
	asm("ldi r17, 0xFF"); //Fill r17 with all 1s
	asm("out 0x0A, r17"); //Set all DDRD for r17
	asm("ldi r16 0x00"); //Initialize counter in r16 to 0
	asm("rjmp start");
}

void loop(){

# AVR Register and Memory

- In ARC, there are 32 general purpose registers
- Any instruction could use any register as an operant
- Using `ld` and `st`, we can address anywhere in memory

- In AVR, specific instructions for accessing specific subset of register file
- Specific instructions for I/O, and memory regions

# SBI - Set Bit in I/O Register

- Sets a specified bit in an I/O register
- The instruction operates on the lower 32 I/O registers (0-31)

```
I/O (A, b) <- 1
SBI A, b | 0 < A < 31, 0 < b < 7
1001 1010 AAAA Abbb
```

# CBR - Clear Bits in Register
- Clears the specified bits in register Rd
- Performs the logical AND between the contents of register Rd and the complement of the constant mask K
- The result will be placed in register Rd

```
Rd <- Rd * ($FF - K)
CBR Rd, K | 16 < d M 31, 0 < K, 255
```

- With CBI, we provide a bit index
- With CBR we provide a bit mask
- Multiple bits can be cleared via 8-bit mask (constant K)

```
Mask (K) =        0011 1100
Complement (K) =  1100 0011
Rd =              1011 0111
Comp (K) and Rd = 1000 0011
```

# SBR - Set Bits in Register

- Sets specified bits in register Rd
- Performs the logical ORI between the contents of register Rd and a constant mask K and placed the result in the destination register Rd

```
Rd <- Rd v K
SBR Rd,  K
0110 KKKK dddd KKKK

Mask (K) =  0011 1100
Rd =        1000 0110
(K) or Rd = 1011 1110
```

# INC - Increment
- Add one to the constant or register Rd and placed the result in the destination register Rd
- The C flag in SREG is not affected

```
Rd <- Rd + 1
INC Rd
1001 010d dddd 0011
```

# DEC - Decrement
- Subtracts one from the contents of register Rd and placed the result in the destination register Rd
- C Flag is not affected

```
Rd <- Rd - 1
DEC Rd
1001 010d dddd 1010
```

# COM - One's Complement
- Performs one's complement of register Rd

```
Rd <- $FF - Rd
COM Rd
1001 010d dddd 0000
// Inverts the bits
  1111 1111
- 0101 1011
  1010 0100
```

# NEG - Two's Complement
- Replaces the contents of register Rd with its two's complement
```
Rd <- $00 - Rd
NEG Rd
1001 010d dddd 0001
// Inverts, adds 1
  1000 0000
  0111 1111
+ 0000 0001
  1000 0000
```

# AND - Logical AND
- Performs the logical AND between the contents of register Rd and register Rr and placed the result in the destination register Rd
```
Rd <- Rd * Rr
AND Rd, Rr
0010 00rd dddd rrrr
```

ANDI - Logical AND with Immediate
- Performs the logical AND between the contents of register Rd and a constant and places the result in Rd
- Rd is register 16-31
- K is 0-255
```
Rd <- Rd * K
ANDI, K
0111 KKKK dddd KKKK
```

# General Purpose vs Registers
- 32 general purpose registers names R0-R31
- Only R16-R31 can load immediate constants
- R26-R31 are 16-bit address pointers for indirect addressing
- Three indirect address registers X, Y, and Z

![[Pasted image 20250331085447.png|500]]

# OR - Logical O
- Performs the logical OR between the contents of register Rd and register Rr and places the result in the destination register Rd
```
Rd <- Rd v Rr
OR Rd, Rr
0010 10rd dddd rrrr
```

# ORI - Logical OR with Immediate
- Performs the logical OR between the contents of register Rd and a constant and places the result in the destination register Rd
```
Rd <- Rd v K
ORI Rd, K
0110 KKKK dddd KKKK
```

# AND - Add without Carry
- Adds two registers without the C flag and places in Rd
```
Rd <- Rd + Rr
ADD Rd, Rr
0000 11rd dddd rrrr
```

# SUB - Subtract without Carry
- Subtracts two registers and places the result in the destination register Rd
```
Rd <- Rd - Rr
SUB Rd, Rr
0001 10rd dddd rrrr
```

# SUBI - Subtract Immediate
- Subtracts a register and a constant and placed in Rd
- Woking on registers R16 to R31
```
Rd <- Rd - K
SUBI Rd, K
0101 KKKK dddd KKKK
```

# ADC - Add with Carry
- Adds two registers and the contents of the C flag and places the result in the destination register Rd
- 32 bits number across four registers
- Add low order byte of each number normally
- This will set the carry bit
- Add remaining bytes from lower to higher order, using ADC instruction
- The result is a 32-bit
```
Rd <- Rd + Rr + C
ADC Rd, Rr
0011 11rd dddd rrrr
```

# SBC - Subtract with Carry
- Subtracts two registers and subtracts with the C flag, placed in Rd
```
Rd <- Rd - Rr - C
SBC Rd, Rr
0000 10rd dddd rrrr
```

# Branching
- Branching in AVR is similar to ARC
- Arithmetic instruction is affects in SREG (status register)

![[Pasted image 20250331090306.png|600]]
![[Pasted image 20250331090327.png]]

- In AVR, most arithmetic instructions store the result back in an operand

`Rd <- Rd + Rr`

- Inputs will be overwritten
- Us CP to compare
# CP - Compare
- Performs a compare between two registers Rd and Rr
- Registers are not changes
- All conditional branches can be used

```
Rd - Rr
CP Rd, Rr
0001 01rd dddd rrrr
```

![[Pasted image 20250331090548.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250331090607.png]]

# BREQ - Branch If Equal
- Conditional relative branch
- Tests the zero flag and branches relatively to PC if Z is set
```
If Rd = Rr (Z = 1), then PC <- PC + K + 1
Else Pc <- PC + 1
BREK K
1111 00kk kkkk k001
```

BREQ - Example

```
cp r1, r0
breq equal
 ...
equal:

# Jumping
- There is no "always branch" in AVR, us RJMP instead

![[Pasted image 20250331090853.png]]

# Calling
- In ARC, jumping did not set the link register, we had to use call
- In AVR, we have call
- These instructions push the program counter onto the stack and update the stack pointer

![[Pasted image 20250331090958.png]]

# RCALL - Relative Call to Subroutine
- Relative call to an address within PC - 2K + 1 and PC + 2K (words)
- - The return address is stored onto the stack
```
PC <- PC + K + 1
RCALL k
1101 kkkk kkkk kkkk
```

# Branching, Jumping, Calling
- Similar to ARC
- A bit harder with differing memory map and stack register/pointer usage

# Digital Input
- Set data direction port for output, clear it for input
- To read digital input, we read from the PIN register, not the data register
- Setting the bit in the data register enable the pull up resistor
- This means that when there is no input, the pin will read 1 (high)
- For the pin to read 0 (low), we have to connect to GND

```
//Clear bit in data direction register
cbi 0x04 0
//Set the bit in the data register
sbi 0x05 0
//Read the bit in the PIN register
in r25, 0x09
```

# READ LED

- Digital input comes from bit 7 in port D
- Clear data direction bit for digital input
- Set data bit for the pullup resistor

```
void setup(){
	asm("sbi 0x04, 5"); //Set onboard LED for output
	asm ("cbi 0x0A, 7"); //Clear PORTD& for input
	asm("sbi 0x0B, 7"); //Set pull-up resistor for D7
}
```

# Joystick
- GND - Connect to GND
- +%5 - Connect to 5V
- SW - Connect to Pin 7
- VRx, Vry - read x and y position
- SW - switch
	- This pin becomes GND when the joystick is pressed

# Instruction For Reading from I/O
- We have SBI and CBI for setting and clearing bits
- Test address of PIND

![[Pasted image 20250331092111.png]]

# IN - Load an I/O Location to Register
- Loads data from I/O space into register
- Mask to read from a specific bit
```
Rd <- I/O(A)
IN Rd, A
1011 0AAd dddd AAAA
```

# JOYSTICK BUTTON PRESS

```c
void setup(){
	asm("sbi 0x04, 5"); //Set on board LED for ouput (pin 13)
	asm("cbi 0x0A, 7"); //Clear PORTD7 for input
	asm("sbi 0x0B, 7"); //Set pullup resistor for D7
}

void loop(){
	asm("in r25, 0x09"); //Load register PIND into r25
	asm("andi r25, 0x80"); //AND with constant 0x80, masking bit 7
	asm("cpi r25, 0x80"); //Compare 0x80 with r25
	asm("brne led_on"); //Z-bit is set (r25 NOT EQ 0x80), goes to led_on

	asm("cbi 0x05, 5"); //Turn led OFF
	asm("rjmp end"); //Go to end

	asm("led_on:");
	asm("sbi 0x05, 5"); //Turn led ON

	asm("end:")
	delay(2);
}
```

- If PD7 is high (button not pressed) r25 is 0x80, since PIND was 0x80 before the making, so the comparison will be equal
- If PD7 is low (button pressed), r25 will be 0x00 (since the AND operation with 0x80 will result in zero), so the comparison will not be equal, causing the z-bit to be set
