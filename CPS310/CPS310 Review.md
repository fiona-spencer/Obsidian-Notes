# 1. Intro, History, and Data Representations

## Definitions

- Computer architecture
	- Refers to the functional behaviour of a computer system as viewed by the programmer
- Computer organization
	- Refers to the structural relationship that are not visible to the programmer

- Levels
	- A concept in computer organization and architecture
	- The computer system can be considered at many levels
	- High level of executing programs
	- Low level of transistors, wires, traces

## History
- Wolf radius bone
- Tally sticks
- Chinese abacus
- Pascal's calculating machine
- Jacquard pattern weaving loom
- Babbage different engine
- Loog up tables
- Ada Lovelace
- Enigma
- Colossus
- ENIAC

## Computability
- To study computability, Alan Turing developed a simple and basic but surprisingly powerful symbol manipulating device
	- a-machine
	- Renames the _Turning machine_
	- First described in 1936

## Turing Machine
1) An arbitrary-length tape
2) A head
3) A state
4) A transition table

- Turing-Church Hypothesis
	- For any algorithm which can be calculated given arbitrary amounts of time and storage, there is an equivalent Turing machine for that algorithm
- Turing Completeness
	- A computational system is Turning Complete if it can be used to emulate a Turing machine
	- Machine code is Turning Complete if it can compute every function computable on a Turing machine

## von Neumann Model
- 5 major components
	1. Memory unit
	2. Input unit
	3. Output unit
	4. Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
	5. Control unit
