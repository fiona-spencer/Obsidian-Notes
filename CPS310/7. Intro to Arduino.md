# Microprocessor vs Microcontroller

Microprocessor
- Microprocessor is a processor packaged in a single _Integrated Circuit (IC)_
- Integrated circuit
	- Compact electronic circuit containing microscopic transistors, resistors, capacitors
	- Built into silicon, packaged in a single chip
- Limitations
	- No memory: external memory is required
	- No I/O: peripheral chips/protocols required to interface with I/) devices
- A microprocessor-based design cannot be made very small and compact
- This leads to the development of _microcontrollers_

Microcontrollers
- Microcontrollers is a microprocessor with _memory and I/O_
- A compact computer packed in a single _Very Large Integration chip (VLSI)_

"With I/O"
- Specific pins that we can read and write signals to 
- Analog to digital converters, serial communication
- Not keyboard, mouse, GPU
- One bit per output pin (0 or 1, high or low)

# Atmel AVR Microcontrollers

- Family of microcontrollers developed since 1996
- Conceived by two students at the Norwegian Institute of Technology
- Commonly accepted that AVR stands for Alf and Vegard's RISC processor
- One of the first to use onboard flash memory instead of PROM, EEPROM
- (Electrically Erasable) Programmable Read-Only Memory
- Very common in embedded systems, popularized by Arduino
- Modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC single-chip microcontroller

# Modified Harvard Architecture

Harvard Architecture:
- Data and instructions are stored in entirely separate memory systems
- Instructions cannot be accessed as data

Modified Harvard Architecture:
- Data and instructions are stored together, both can be accessed as data

- Most modern systems claiming to be Harvard Architecture, are in face Modified Harvard Architecture

# ATMega328p

- Chip manual
- AVR instruction set
- This is the DIP (Dual Inline Package) of the 328p
- Two rows of pins, can mount on a breadboard
- Constrast to SMD (Surface Mount Device)
- Soldered to surface of PCB
- Cannot be used in breadboard prototyping

ATMega328p: Data sheet
- Contains all information about the physical MCU
- Operating temperatures, voltage ranges, dimensions

- One word in AVR = 16-bits
- AVR instructions are one word

```
Operation
Rd <-- Rd + Rr

Syntax
ADD Rd, Rr

16-bit Opcode

# ATMega328p: Internal Buses

# General Purpose vs I/O Registers

General purpose registers
- Can be used directly in assembler commands
- Connected directly to the ALU
- Source and destination for calculations
	- Arithmetic, logical, and bit-functions
- 32 general purpose registers named R0-R32
- Only R16-R31 can load immediate constants (LDI)
- R26-R31 are 16 bit address pointers for indirect addressing of the data space
- Three indirection address registers X, Y, and Z
![[Pasted image 20250330121731.png|500]]
- Load high and low order bits of address into high and low order registers of X, Y, and Z
- Address is stores as Little Endian
- Low order bits at lower address/register
- Access memory via X, Y, Z using LD and ST instructions

**X**  Read/write from address X, do not change the pointer

`LD R1, X`
`ST X, R1`

**X+** Read/write from/to address X and increment the pointer by one

`LD R1, X+`
`ST X+, R1`

**-X** Decrement the pointer by one and read/write from/to the new address

`LD R1, -X`
`ST -X, R1`

# AVR Instruction Set - LD
![[Pasted image 20250330122050.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250330122104.png]]
```
0b 1000 000d dddd 1000
0b 100000 ddddd 1000
```

- 5 bits for destination
- 32 general purpose registers

Example

```
clr r29
ldi r28, $60
ld r0, Y+
ld r1, Y
ldi r28, $63
ld r2, Y
ld r3, -Y
ldd r4, Y+2
```


CLR - Clear Register

- Performs an Exclusive OR between a register and itself, clear all bits in the register

```
Rd <-- Rd XOR Rd
CLR Rd

0010 01dd dddd dddd

- - - 0 0 0 1 -
```


EOR - Exclusive OR

- Performs the logical EOR between the contents of register Rd and register Rr and places the result in the destination register Rd

```
Rd <-- Rd EOR Rr
EOR Rd, Rr

0010 00rd dddd rrrr


```


LDI - Load Immediate

- Loads an 8 bits constant directly to register 16 to 31
- 4 bits for d
- Leading 1 is implied (dddd -> 1dddd)

```
Rd <-- K
LDI Rd, K

1110 KKKK dddd KKKK

Status Register is unchanged
```


LPM - Load Program Memory

- Loads one byte pointed by the Z-register into the destination register Rd

```
Rd <-- (Z)
LPM Rd, Z
```




- 32-bit ARC was ideal, simulated, and did not correspond to an actual microprocessor

# Special Purpose Registers

Program Counter (PC)
- 16-bit register (0x0000-0xFFFF)
- Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed

Instruction Register (IR)
- Control unit decodes contents of IR and generates appropriate control signals

Stack Pointer (SP)
- Actually exists and works as a stack is supposed to
- Recall ARC didn't actually implement the stack for us
- Access and operate on stack using specific instructions
![[Pasted image 20250330122221.png]]
- Data is 8bits, address are 16 bits
- Pointer moves by 1 bytes when pushing and popping
- Pointer moves by 2 bytes when calling and returning

Status Register (SREG)
- Contains info about result of most recent arithmetic instruction
- Updated after all ALU operations
- Not automatically stored and restored during interrupts
- Recall rd and wr in ARC

# Addressing Modes

- In ARC, we used the same ld and st mnemonics to address in multiple ways
- In AVR, depending on the addressing mode, we can have load and store instructions with completely different mnemonics

# Addressing Modes: Direct
- Register Direct, Single Register Rd
	- Address hardcoded in OP
	- Rd = destination register
- Register Direct, Two Registers Rd and Rr
	- Load from address in Rr, store in Rd
	- Or vice versa
- I/O Direct Addressing
	- A is 6 bits, refers to an I/O address
	- Rr/Rd depend on whether we are reading or writing
- Direct Data addressing
	- Two word instruction
	- 16 LSBs form data address
- Data indirect
- Data indirect with pre-decrement
- Data indirect with post-increment
- Data indirect with displacement


# General Purpose vs I/O Register
- Use ports B, C, D on the Atmega328p
- Pins on the chip correspond to each port

PORTB - The Port B Data Register

```
0x05 (0x25)

0x04 (0x24)
```

- First bracket is the actual location in the memory map
- The first value is how we access the register

Memory Map
- General purpose registers are mapped from 0x00 to 0x15
- I/o registers are from 0x20 to 0x5F
- Extended I/O registers are from 0x60 to 0xFF

# Register Summary

![[Pasted image 20250330123043.png]]

# CBI, SBI

CBI - Clear Bit in I/O Register
- Clears a specified bit in an I/O register

```
I/O (A, b) <-- 0

CBI A, b

1001 1000 AAAA Abbb
```

- AAAAA is the address of the I/O register
- bbb is the bit we want to clear (0-7)

SBI - Set Bit in I/O Register
- Sets a specified bit in an I/O register

```
I/O (A, b) <-- 1

SBI A, b

1001 1010 AAAA Abbb
```

- Data register is connected to the Arduino pins
- Data direction register is set/cleared the same way
- Determines if the pin is to be used for input or output

- Set these physical pins to 0 or 1, low or high
- Ports are used for input and output
- Toggle between these using data direction
- Data register is connected to the Arduino pins
- Data direction register is set/cleared the same way
- It determines if the pin is to be used for input or output
- Set mean output, clear means input
