# Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

- A compiler translates a High-Level Language (HLL), which is architecture independent, into assembly language
- Compile typically refers to translating an HLL into assembly or machine code
- Assembly and machine code are architecture dependent
- An assembler translates assembly langauge programs into executable binary programs

# ISA Level: System Bus Model

- Program
	- User writes program in HLL
	- Compiler translates into assembly
	- Assembler translates into machine code, stored on disk
	- Prior to execution, program loaded into memory

- During execution
	- Instructions loaded into CPU form memory one at a time
	- CPU executes instructions, may generates address
	- Address placed on address but, received by memory
	- Memory writes data at that address to the data bus

# ISA Level: Memory

- A collection of consecutively numbered cells
- Each cell is typically one byte, 8 bits
- Memory is byte-addressable, but most data types are larger than one byte
- An integer is 4 bytes (32-bits)
- CPU writes the integer at a single bytes address in memory

# ISA Level: Big/Little Endian

- Big-endian: MSB is stored at lowest address
- Little-endian: LSB stored at lowest address

- Multi-byte words are always accessed by their lowest address
- Bits within a byte are always Big Endian

- Big Endian Advantage
	- Matches how we read the number, left to right

- Little Endian Advantage
	- If we need to allocate an extra byte to a number as it grows
	- Do not need to shift all the bytes over and add to the front
	- Add another byte to the MSB end, LSB can stay put

# ISA Level: Memory Map

- A memory map outlines the regions of allocated memory

![[Pasted image 20250305125610.png|400]]

- ARC architecture is used
- Lowest address is 0
- Highest address is $total - 1$
- Cannot arbitrarily address into memory, some portions are reserved
	- OS location in memory
- Map includes both RAM and IO
- IO devices are treated like memory locations
	- Not actual locations in RAM
- RAM location = 0 to $2^{31} - 1$
- IO location = 0 to $2^{31} - 2^{32}$

- Flat address space
	- Address space refers to the numerical range of memory address to which the CPU can refer
	- A flat address space means a single address space for everything
		- Main memory, IO
	- Size of the address space is bounded by the size of the address bus
		- 32-bit address space => $2^{32} = 4,294,967,296 =~ 4 GB$

# Address vs Data

- An address is a pointer to a location in memory
- Data is the value at that memory location

# Fetch-Execute Cycle

- CPU
	- Data section with registers and ALU
	- Control unit for interpreting and executing instructions
	- Interface between control and data units formed by 2 registers
		- Program Counter (PC)
			- Hold address of next instruction to be fetched
		- Instruction Register (IR)
			- Holds next instruction to be executed

- Fetch-execute cycle
	1) Fetch instruction to be executed
		1) Indicated by the PC
	2) Decode the opcode
		1) Depends on instruction set
	3) Read operands from memory
	4) Execute instruction and store results
	5) Repeat step 1

- Fetching refers to the retrieval of the next instruction, as pointed by the program counter
- Execution involved decoding the instruction and performing the required opcode
- Opcode specifies what exactly the instructions do
	- Data movement, Arithmetic, memory formats


# CPU: Control Unit

- The control unit coordinates all other units in the process of executing an instruction
- Though of as a "computer within a computer"
- Tells the ALU what to do with what registers, loads registers, copies registers back to memory


# CPU: Datapath

- Register file: collection of registers
	- Managed by control unit
	- Register sized correspond to word sizes
	- Anywhere from a few to a few 1000
- Registers are addressable, just like main memory
- Orders of magnitude faster
- ALU updates status register
- Indicate overflow, divided by 0, parity or result


# CPU: ALU

- Control unit tells ALU what to do, and with what registers
- ALU implements a variety of binary (2 operand) and unary operations
	- Binary
		- Addition
		- Bit wise AND
		- Bit shift
	- Unary
		- Arithmetic negation
		- Bitwise NOT
- Control directs ALU based on instruction being executed
- Instruction indicated operation and source/destination registers

# Instruction Set

- A collection of instructions that a process can execute
- A processor is defined by its instruction set

3 Main Categories
1) Data movement
	1) Move data back and forth between CPU and memory or I/O
2) Arithmetic and logic
	1) Perform operation on data in registers
3) Control
	1) Transfer control from one section of program to another
		1) Branching
		2) Calling subroutines

- Instruction sets can vary drastically between CPU families
	- Instruction size (length)
	- Operations supported/allowed
	- Types of operands allowed
	- Types of results provided

- Contrast with this HLL source code, typically instruction set does not need to change between CPU architectures (just recompiled)
- Given the right compiler, the same source code can be turned into machined code compatible with any given CPU's instruction set

Java
- Java, once compiled into byte-code, can be used on any platform that has a corresponding JVM
- Java code does not vary by platform, the JVM does
- JVM compiled for target architecture, Java code compiled for for JVM

- Computer systems are often identified by their CPU, where determines the type of instruction set
- Programs compiled for an IBM PC system use 80x86 instruction set

Operation Systems complicate this further:
- Windows and Linux machines can have the same CPU
- A program compiled in Windows will not work out of the box in Linux
- Different APIs (the way each OS interacts with its hardware)

# Model Instruction Set: ARC

- ARC (A RISC computer) is based on the _Scalable Processor Architecture_ (SPARC)
- SPARC is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
	- A small set of simple instruction
		- Accesses memory through specific load/store instruction, as opposed to as a part of most instruction

# Risc vs CISC

- CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
	- Instead of a small set of general instructions, large set of highly specific instructions
	- A single CISC instruction might accomplish several things at once
		- Load from memory
		- Perform arithmetic
		- Store result back to memory
- Instructions cycles are no CPU cycles
- One single instruction might take multiple CPU cycles to complete
- CISC has a small set of general instruction
- Separate instructions for loading, arithmetic, and storing
- Fewer CPU cycles per instructions

Architectures most commonly considered RISC vs CISC:

RISC:
- SPARC
- Atmel AVR
- ARM
- Power ISA

CISC:
- IMB System/360
- IMB z/Architecture
- Motorola 6800, 6809
- Intel 8080, x86

# Model Instruction Set: ARC

- ARC has the most important features of SPARC, without the complex aspects required in a commercial process

# ARC ISA: Memory


- 32-bit data types
- Cannot address beyond 32-bits
- Can only reference first ~4GB
- Memory is byte addressable
	- All data is stored as bytes
	- Multi-byte types are bid-endian
	- Address of 32-bit word is address of the byte with the lowest address
- 32-bit address space is divided into distinct regions
	1) OS: lowest $2^{11} = 2048$
	2) User space: starts at $2048$
		1) User's assembled programs
		2) Grows upwards until it meets system stack
	3) System stack: starts at word $2^{31}-4$
		1) Grow downward until it meets user space
	4) IO Devices: $2^{31}$ to $2^{32}-1$
		1) Each IO device has some address range assigned to it
			1) Memory-mapped IO

# ARC ISA: User-Visible Registers

![[Pasted image 20250305134228.png|500]]
- Registers are accessed by the assembly programmer
- Cannot access IR
- IR is loaded based on PC
- %r0 are mnemonics
- Names are used to access registers
- 32, 32-bit registers
- %r1 - %r31 are general purpose registers
- %r0 always contain 0
- %r14 double as stack pointer
- %r15 doubles as link register
- %pc = program counter
	- Address of next executable instruction
- %psr = process status register
	- Info about CPU state
	- 1-bit condition code
		- Zero (Z)
		- Negative (N)
		- Carry (C)
		- Overflow (V)

- Support for traps
	- Traps are a mechanism for interrupting normal processing
	- Result of exception or interrupt

- Exception
	- Condition making it impossible for CPU to continue executing without software intervention
- Interrupt
	- Request for CPU attention by external device

# ARC ISA: Instruction Set

- SPARC has ~200 instructions, ARC is a subset of that
- All ARC instructions are 32 bits long (1 word)

Arch is a Load-Store machine:
- Before an ARC instruction can access operands, they must be loaded into registers


# ARC: First Assembly Program

```Python
		.begin
		.org 2048
prog1:  ld [x], %r1
		ld [y], %r2
		addcc %r1, %r2, %r3
		st %r3, [z]
		halt
x:      15
y:      9
z:      0
```

- Assembly is architecture specific
- Assembly get assembled by the assembler into machine language
- Machine language is the binary bit strings loaded and decoded by the CPU
- One to one mapping between assembly and machine instruction
- Compilers might optimize HLL in different ways

- Mnemonics are names for specific instruction
- Instead of a series of machine language opcodes, names are used
- Labels must be followed by a colon
- Numbers in ARC assembly are treated as being in base 10
- This constant is called an _immediate constant_

- Immediate constants
	- Can be used immediately, do not need to load into register first
	- Limited to 13 bits
	- Range of [-4096, 4095]
	- Sign-extended to 32-bits to be used by the ALU
	- Left most bit of 13-bit immediate constant is copied leftwards until the number is 32 bits

# ARC: Load and Store

`ld [%r1], %r3`
`st %r3, %r1`

- The `[]` indicate loading from the address contained in register
