# The Von Neumann Model

- Five major components
	1) Memory unit
		1) Stores memory
	2) Input unit
		1) Provides instructions and data to the system
	3) Output unit
		1) Results are sent out
	4) Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
		1) Data/instructions processed by ALU at the request of the control unit
	5) Control unit
		1) The ALU and control unit are referred to as the CPU

- The von Neumann model allowed programs to be saved in memory
- Gave rise to modern compilers and operating systems
- Model has been streamlined into the System Bus Model

# System Bus Model

- Buses are shared between components
- A _bus_ is a collection of wires or traces
- 64-bit bus = 64 parallel wires carrying one bit each
- Every communicating entity will have an address
- Address bus might refer to an IO device, or a specific location in memory

# Levels of Organization

1. User level: Application program
2. High level languages
3. Assembly language
4. Microprogrammed/hardwired control
5. Functional units (Memory, ALU, etc)
6. Logic gates
7. Low level: Transistors and wires

- Machine code is binary bit strings
- Nature of bit strings depend on Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Assembly adds mnemonics
- Microprogrammed = firmware
	- Permanent, read-only memory
- Hardwire = physically fixed in hardware, actual circuitry
- Logic gates is the lowest level at which any sort of high level functioning can be considered
- Transistors uses voltage and current
	- Signal propagation delay: time it takes the signal to travel the circuit
	- Reason CPUs cannot get larger
	- Quantum effects must also be considered
		- Transistors can only get so small before quantum tunnelling is a risk

# Binary Numbers

- A bytes is 8 bits

```
128 64  32  16  8   4   2   1
2^7 2^6 2^5 2^4 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0
0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
```

- Decimal numbers use a base 10 number system
- Binary uses a base 2 number system

Convert Binary to Decimal

# Hexadecimal

- Hexadecimal use a base 16 number system
- 0 - 9 are represented by numbers, 10 - 15 is represented by [A-F]

![[Pasted image 20250305115227.png|400]]

Hexadecimal to Binary
- One hex digit is comprised of 4 binary digits

```
0x A    B    C    1    2    3 
0b 1010 1011 1100 0001 0010 0011

0xABC123 = ob101010111100000100100011
```

# One's Complement

- One's complement is used in signed magnitude
- Positive numbers can be represented normally, with the left most bit being 0
- If negative, then bits are inverted

Represent $-9$ in one's complement

```
0d9 = 0b  0000 1001
0d-9 = 0b 1111 0110 <- one's complement
```

# Two's Complement

- Use in signed magnitude to represent negative numbers
- Two's complement takes one's complements, but adds a 1

```
0d9 = 0b  0000 1001
0d-9 = 0b 1111 0110 <- one's complement
+ 1
0d-9 = 0b 1111 0111 <- two's complement
```

# Real/Floating Point Numbers

- Real numbers are represented using sign bit, a mantissa, and an exponent

```
    2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0 2^(-1) 2^(-2) 2^(-3) 2^(-4)
0b  0   1   0   1   1      1      1      1
0b 0101.1111 = 0d5.9375
```

# Floating Point: IEEE-754

- IEEE-754 representation is the most widely used standard for floating point computation

32-bit
```
0 00000000 00000000000000000000000
^ --------
sign bit, Exponent(8 bits), Mantissa(23 bits)
```

64-bit
```
0 00000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000...
^ -----------
sign bit, Exponent(11 bits), Mantissa(52 bits)
```

- Floating point numbers are represented differently than integers
- Integers are precise, floating points are almost never
- Double-precision (64-bit) floating points are more accurate, that single precision (32-bit)
- Floating point values exist on an infinite continuum
- Between any two floating point values are an infinite number of additional floating-point values
- Integers are discrete, and have finite number of integers between

# Representation Consideration

- The range is the interval between the lowest and highest number
[- 99, +99]

- The precision is the distance between successive numbers
1

- The maximum error, is the different between the value of a real number and closest representable number
$1 * 1/2 = 0.5$

# Radix Number Systems
- Representing conversion to decimal from arbitrary radix

# Base Conversion: Remainder Method


Convert $(23.375)_{10}$ to base-2

Integer Portion
```
       Integer, Remainder
23/2 = 11  1 <- LSB
11/2 = 5   1
5/2 =  2   1
2/2 =  1   0
0/2 =  0   1 <- MSB

0d23 = 0b10111
```

Fraction Portion
```
       Integer, Fraction
0.375 * 2 = 0.75 <- MSB
0.75 *  2 = 1.5
0.5 *   2 = 1.0 <- LSB

0d0.375 = 0b0.011
```

Integer + Fraction
```
0d23.375 = 0b10111.011
```

- The remainder method works for any radix, simply change the divisor and multiple from 2 to the desired radix

Non-Terminating Fraction
- Will go on forever until we run out of bits
- The same is true  of irrational number in base 10

# Signed Fixed Point Numbers

- For an 8-bit number, there are $2^8 = 256$ possible bit patterns
- Unsigned integers can represent integers [0-255]
- In one's complement 0 is represented by 111 = -0 and 000 = +0
- Comparison is more difficult
- Two's complement, only has one representation of 0
	- Has a range of [-128, 127]
- Excess or bias is the bit pattern that is shifted by subtracting bias from it
- The bias is calculated from the number of bits present

$Bias = 2^{(Exponent Bits - 1)} - 1$

4-bit has an Excess-3
$2^{(3-1)} - 1 = 3$

8-bit has an Excess-127
$2^{(8-1)} - 1 = 127$

# Floating Point Numbers: IEEE-754 Representation
- Most widely used standard for floating point computation

Components:
1) Sign
2) Exponent
	1) Exponent is biased
3) Mantissa
	1) Normalized

Ex. Convert $-12.625_{10}$ in single precision IEEE-754 format

```
Integer 0d-12

12/2 = 6 0
6/2  = 3 0
3/2  = 1 1
1/2  = 0 1

0d-12 = 0b1100

Decimal 0d0.625

0.625 * 2 = 1.25
0.25 * 2  = 0.5
0.5 * 2   = 1.0

0d0.625 = 0b0.101

0d-12.625 = 0b1100.101
0b1.100101 <- normalized, exp = 3

3 + 127 = 130 <- biased exponenet

------------------
Sign: 1
Exponent:
0d130 = 0b1000 0010

Mantissa: 100101
------------------
1 10000010 1001 0100 0000 0000 0000 000
```

- Leading 1 is not included in the bit pattern, considered hidden bit
