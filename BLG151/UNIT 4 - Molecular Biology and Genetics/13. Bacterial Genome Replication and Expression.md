# 13.3 - DNA Replication in Bacteria

---
## Bacterial DNA Replication Initiates from a Single Origin of Replication
## Many Enzymes Are Needed for DNA Replication
## Termination of Replication Requires Steps to Separate Daughter Chromosomes

# 13.4 - Bacterial Genes Consist of Coding Regions and Other Sequences Important for Gene Function

---
## Protein-Coding Genes
## tRNA and rRNA Genes

# 13.5 - Transcription in Bacteria

---
## Bacterial RNA Polymerases Consist of Five Different Proteins
## Stages of Transcription: Initiation, Elongation, and Termination

# 13.6 - The Genetic Code Consists of Three-Letter "words"

# 13.7 - Translation in Bacteria

---
## Amino Acid Activation: Attachment of an Amino Acid to a Transfer RNA
## Stages of Translation: Initiation, Elongation, and Termination
## Insertion of Selenocysteine and Pyrrolysine
## Ensuring Accuracy During Translation

# 13.8 - Coordination of Gene Expression Processes

---
## Colliding Polymerases
## Coupled Transcription and Translation
# 13.9 - Protein Maturation and Secretion

---
## Modifications to the N-Terminus of a Polypeptide
## Molecular Chaperones: Proteins that Help Proteins Fold
## Protein Translocation and Secretion in Bacteria
### Translocation Systems Are Common to Both Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria
### Secretion in Gram-Negative Bacteria Requires Crossing Two Membranes
### Two-Step Secretion Systems
### One-Step Secretion Systems
