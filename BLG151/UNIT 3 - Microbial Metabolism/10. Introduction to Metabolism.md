# 10.1 - Metabolism: Important Principles and Concepts

---

**Metabolism** - the total of all chemical reactions in the cell; almost all are enzyme catalyzed

**Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)** - a high-energy molecule that serves as the cell's major form of energy currency

**Thermodynamics** - a science that analyzes energy changes in a system

**First law of thermodynamics** - energy can be neither created nor destroyed (although it can be changes in form or redistributed)

**Second law of thermodynamics** - physical and chemical processes proceed in such a way that the entropy of the universe (the system and its surrounding) increases to the maximum possible

**Entropy** - a measure of the randomness of disorder of a system; a measure of that part of the total energy in a system that is unavailable for useful work

**Calorie** - the amount if heat needed to raise one gram of water from 14.5C
