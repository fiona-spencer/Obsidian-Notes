# 10.1 - Metabolism: Important Principles and Concepts

---

**Metabolism** - the total of all chemical reactions in the cell; almost all are enzyme catalyzed

**Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)** - a high-energy molecule that serves as the cell's major form of energy currency

**Thermodynamics** - a science that analyzes energy changes in a system

**First law of thermodynamics** - energy can be neither created nor destroyed (although it can be changes in form or redistributed)

**Second law of thermodynamics** - physical and chemical processes proceed in such a way that the entropy of the universe (the system and its surrounding) increases to the maximum possible

**Entropy** - a measure of the randomness of disorder of a system; a measure of that part of the total energy in a system that is unavailable for useful work

**Calorie** - the amount if heat needed to raise one gram of water from 14.5C to 15.5C






## Cellular Work and Energy Transfer

**Enthalpy** - heat content of a system

**Free energy change ($\delta G$)** the total energy change in a system that is available to do useful work as the system goes from its initial state to its final state at constant temperature and pressure

**Equilibrium** - the state of a system in which no net change is occuring and free energy is at a minimum
- In a chemical reaction at equilibrium, the rates in the forward and reverse directions exactly balance each other out

**Equilibrium constant ($K_{eq}$)** - a value that relates the concentration of reactants and products to each other when a reaction is at equilibrium

**Standard free energy change** - the free energy change of a reaction at atmosphere pressure when all reactants and products are present in their standard states; usually the temperature is 25C

**Exergonic reaction** - a reaction that spontaneously goes to completion as written; the standard free energy change is negative, and the equilibrium constant is greater than one

**Endergonic reaction** - a reaction that does not spontaneously go to completion as written; the standard free energy change is positive, and the equilibrium constant is less than one


## Free Energy Change Predicts the Nature of a Chemical Reaction

# 10.2 - ATP: The Major Energy Currency of Cells

---

**Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)** - the nucleodisphosphate usually formed upone the breakdown of ATP when it provides energy for work

**High phosphate transfer potential** - a characteristic of a phosphorylated compound such that it readily transfers a phosphoryl group to another molecules

**Substrate-level phosphorylation** - the synthesis of ATP from ADP by phosphorylation coupled with the exergonic breakdown of a high-energy organic substrate molecule



# 10.3 - Redox Reactions: Reactions of Central Importance in Metabolism

---

**Oxidative-reduction (redox) reaction** - reactions involving electron transfer; the electron donner (reductant) give electrons to an electron acceptor (oxidant)

**Electron donor** - an electron donor in an oxidation-reduction reaction
- Often called a reducing agent or reductant

**Electron acceptor** - a com
