# 11.1 - Metabolic Diversity and Nutritional Types

---
## Nutritional Types Are Defined by the Source of Organism's Energy, Electrons, and Carbon


**Phototrophs** - organisms that use light as their energy source
**Chemotrophs** - organisms that obtain energy from the oxidation of chemical compounds
**Lithotrophs** - an organism that uses reduced inorganic compounds as its election source
**Organiotrophs** - organisms that use reduced organic compounds as their electron source
**Heterotrophs** - an organisms that uses reduced, preformed organic molecules as its principal carbon source
**Autotrophs** - an organisms that uses $CO_2$ as its sole or principal source of carbon


**Chemolithoautotroph** - a microorganisms that oxidizes reduced inorganic compounds to derive both energy and electron, $CO_2$ is the carbon source
**Photolithoautotroph** - an organism that uses light energy, an inorganic election source ($H_2O, H_2, H_2S$), and $CO_2$ as its carbon source
- Also called photolithotrophic autotroph or a photoautotroph


**Chemoorganioheterotroph** - an organism that uses organic compounds as sources of energy, electrons, and carbon for biosynthesis
- Also called chemoheterotroph and chemoorganictrophic h

**Photoorganoheterotroph** - a microorganism that light energy, organic electron sources, and organic molecules as a carbon source
- Also called photoorganiotrophic heterotroph


**Chemolithoheterotrophs** - 


## Fuelling Reactions Convert Energy, Electron, and Carbon Sources into ATP, Reducing Power, and Precursor Metabolites

# 11.2 - There Are Two Chemoorganotrophic Fuelling Processes

---

# 11.3 - Aerobic Respiration Starts with Glucose Oxidation

---
## Embden-Meyerhof Pathway: The Most Common Route to Pyruvate
## Entner-Doudoroff Pathway
## Pentose Phosphate Pathway: A Major Producer of Reducing Power for Anabolic Reactions
## Pyruvate Dehydrogenase and the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

# 11.4 - Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation Generate the Most ATP

---
## Electron Transport Chains
## Oxidative Phosphorylation
## ATP Yield During Aerobic Respiration

# 11.5 - Anaerobic Respiration Uses the Same Steps as Aerobic Respiration

---
# 11.6 - Fermentation Does Not Involved an Electron Transport Chain

---

# 11.7 - Catabolism of Organic Molecules Other than Glucose

---
## Carbohydrates
## Lipid Catabolism
## Protein and Amin Acid Catabolism

# 11.8 - Chemolithotrophy: "Eating Rocks"

---

# 11.9 - Flavin-Based Electron Bifurcation

---
## Light Reactions in Oxygenic Photosynthesis
### Two Photosystems Working Together Generate ATP and NADPH; Oxygen Is Released
### Photosystem I Working Along Yields Only ATP
## Light Reactions in Anoxygenic Photosynthesis
## Rhodopsin-Based Phototrophy

# 11.10 - Phototrophy
