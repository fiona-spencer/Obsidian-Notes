# 11.1 - Metabolic Diversity and Nutritional Types

---
## Nutritional Types Are Defined by the Source of Organism's Energy, Electrons, and Carbon
## Fuelling Reactions Convert Energy, Electron, and Carbon Sources into ATP, Reducing Power, and Precursor Metabolites

# 11.2 - There Are Two Chemoorganotrophic Fuelling Processes

---

# 11.3 - Aerobic Respiration Starts with Glucose Oxidation

---
## Embden-Meyerhof Pathway: The Most Common Route to Pyruvate
## Entner-Doudoroff Pathway
## Pentose Phosphate Pathway: A Major Producer of Reducing Power for Anabolic Reactions
## Pyruvate Dehydrogenase and the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

# 11.4 - Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation Generate the Most ATP

---
## Electron Transport Chains
## Oxidative Phosphorylation
## ATP Yield During Aerobic Respiration

# 11.5 - Anaerobic Respiration Uses the Same Steps as Aerobic Respiration

---
# 11.6 - Fermentation Does Not Involved an Electron Transport Chain

---

# 11.7 - Catabolism of Organic Molecules Other than Glucose

---
## Carbohydrates
## Lipid Catabolism
## Protein and Amin Acid Catabolism

# 11.8 - Chemolithotrophy: "Eating Rocks"

---

# 11.9 - Flavin-Based Electron Bifurcation

---
## Light Reactions in Oxygenic Photosynthesis
### Two Photosystems Working Together Generate ATP and NADPH; Oxygen Is Released
### Photosystem I Working Along Yields Only ATP
## Light Reactions in Anoxygenic Photosynthesis
## Rhodopsin-Based Phototrophy

# 11.10 - Phototrophy
