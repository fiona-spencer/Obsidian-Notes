# 12.2 - Precursor Metabolites: Starting Molecules for Biosynthesis

---

# 12.3 - Co2 Fixation: Reduction and Assimilation of CO2 Carbon

---
## Calvin-Benson Cycle
## Other CO2-Fixation Pathways

# 12.4 - Synthesis of Carbohydrates

---
## Synthesis of Monosaccharides and Polysaccharides Often Involved Nucleoside Diphosphate Carriers
## Synthesis of Peptidoglycan Occurs in the Cytoplasm, at the Plasma Membrane, and in the Periplasmic Space
# 12.5 - Synthesis of Amino Acids Consumes Many Precursor Metabolites

---
## Inorganic Nitrogen Assimilation
### Ammonia Incorporation Occurs in Two Ways
### Assimilatory Nitrate Reduction: NO3 to NH3
### Nitrogen Fixation: N2 to NH3
## Sulfur Assimilation: SO4 to S-Bearing Molecules
## Amino Acid Biosynthetic Pathways
## Anaplerotic Reactions Replace the Precursor Metabolites Used for Amino Acid Biosynthesis

# 12.6 - Synthesis of Purines, Pyrimidines, and Nucleotides

---
## Phosphorus Assimilation
## Purine Biosynthesis
## Pyrimidine Biosynthesis

# 12.7 - Lipid Synthesis

---
## Fatty Acids and Phospholipids
## Sterols and Isoprenoid Lipids
## Lipopolysaccharides
