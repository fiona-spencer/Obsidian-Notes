# 12.1 - Principles Governing Biosynthesis

---
**Macromolecules** - a large molecule that is a polymer of smaller units joined togethers



# 12.2 - Precursor Metabolites: Starting Molecules for Biosynthesis

---


**Precursor metabolites** - intermediate of glycolytic pathways, TCA cycle, and other pathways that serve as starting molecules for biosynthetic pathways that generate monomers and other building blocks needed for synthesis of macromolecules
**Central metabolic pathways** - Those pathways central to the metabolism of an organism because they function catabolically and anabolically (glycolytic pathways and tricarboxylic acid cycle)



# 12.3 - Co2 Fixation: Reduction and Assimilation of CO2 Carbon

---
## Calvin-Benson Cycle

**Calvin-Benson cycle** - the main pathway for fixation (reduction and incorporation) of $CO_2$ into organic material by photoautotrophs and chemilitoautotrophs
**Ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO)** - the enzyme that catalyzes incorporation of $CO_2$ in the Calvin-Benson cycle

## Other CO2-Fixation Pathways

**Reductive TCA cycle** - a pathway used by some chemolithotrophs and some anoxygenic phototrophs to fix $CO_2$
- Involved the TCA cycle running in the reverse direction, also called reverse citric acid cycle


# 12.4 - Synthesis of Carbohydrates

---
**gluconeogenesis** - the synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors such as lactase and amino acids


## Synthesis of Monosaccharides and Polysaccharides Often Involved Nucleoside Diphosphate Carriers
## Synthesis of Peptidoglycan Occurs in the Cytoplasm, at the Plasma Membrane, and in the Periplasmic Space

**Transpeptidation** - the reaction that forms the peptide cross-links during peptidoglycan
- Reaction that forms peptide bond during the elongation cycle of protein synthesis
# 12.5 - Synthesis of Amino Acids Consumes Many Precursor Metabolites

## Inorganic Nitrogen Assimilation
### Ammonia Incorporation Occurs in Two Ways

**Reductive amination pathway** - a mechanisms used by many microbes to incorporate ammonia

**Transaminases** - an enzyme that catalyzes a transamination reaction

**Glutamine synthease-glutamate synthase (GS-GOGAT) system** - a mechanisms used by many microbes to incorporate ammonia into carbon skeletons

### Assimilatory Nitrate Reduction: NO3 to NH3

**Assimilatiry nitrate reduction** - the reduction of an inorganic molecule to incorporate it into organic material
- No energy is conserved during this process

**Dissimilatory nitrate reduction** - the use of a substance as an electron acceptor for an electron transport chain
- The acceptor (sulfate or nitrite) is reduced but incorporated into organic matter

### Nitrogen Fixation: N2 to NH3

**Nitrogen fixation** - the metabolic process in which atmospheric molecular nitrogen ($N_2$) is reduced to ammonia, carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea

**Diazotroph** an organism capable of fixing nitrogen

**Nitrogenase** - the enzyme that catalyzes biological nitrogen fixation


## Sulfur Assimilation: SO4 to S-Bearing Molecules

**Assimilatory reduction** - the reduction of an inorganic molecule to incorporate it into organic material
- No energy is conserved during this process

**Dissamiltory reduction** - the use of a substrate as an electron acceptor for an electron transport chain
- The acceptor is reduced but not incorporated into organic matter

## Amino Acid Biosynthetic Pathways
## Anaplerotic Reactions Replace the Precursor Metabolites Used for Amino Acid Biosynthesis

**Anapleroitic reaction** - reactions that replenish depleted tricarboyxlic acid cycle intermediates

**Glyoxylate cycle** - a modified tricarboyxlic acid cycle in which the decarboxylation reactions are bypassed by the enzymes isolcitrate lyase and malate synthease; used to convert acetyl-CoA to succinate and other metabolites

## Phosphorus Assimilation

**Purines** - a heterocyclic, nitrogen-containing molecule with two joined rings that occurs in nucleic acids and other cell constituents (adenine and guanine)
**Pyrimidines** - a nitrogen-containing molecule with one ring that occurs in nucleic acids and other cell constituents
- Cytosine, thymine, and uracil


**Adenine** - 
**Guanine** - 

**Nucleoside** - 
**Nucleotide** - 
**d** - 

## Purine Biosynthesis

**Phosphatases** - an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic removal of phosphate from molecules

## Pyrimidine Biosynthesis

## Fatty Acids and Phospholipids

**Fatty acid synthase** - the multi-enzyme complex that makes fatty acids
## Sterols and Isoprenoid Lipids
