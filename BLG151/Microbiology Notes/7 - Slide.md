# 13.1 - Experiments Using Bacterial and Viruses Demonstrated that DNA is the Genetic Material

## Griffith's Transformation Experiments

- Once thought that DNA was too simple a molecule to store genetic information
	- Only 4 different nucleotide
- Argued that proteins, being composed of 20 amino acids, where a better candidate for cellular function
- Fred Griffith (1928) studying the transfer of virulence in pathogen _Streptococcus penumoniae_, called pneumococcus

## Experiments Demonstrated that a Cellular Component Transformed Non-pathogenic Bacteria into Pathogenic Bacteria

- Mice dies of pneumonia when inhected with pathogenic strains of pneumococci, which have a capsule and form smooth-looking colonies (S strain)
- Mice survived when injected with non-pathogenic strains of pneumococci, which lack a capsule and form rough colonies (R strain)
- Injection with heat-killed S strains had no effect
- Injection with a live R strain and heat-killed S strain gave the mice pneumonia, and live S strain penumococci could be isolated form the dead mice

## Griffith's Transformation Experiments
- When he injected a combination of killed virulent bacteria and a living non-virulent strain, the mice died
	- He could recover living virulent bacteria from dead mice
- Griffith called this change of non-virulent bacteria into virulent pathogens, _transformation_

## Transformation Principle
- Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1944) showed that the transforming principle was DNNA
- Transformation of non-virulent bacteria was blocked only if DNase treated
- To demonstrate that contaminating molecules in the DNA extract were not responsible for transformation, the DNA extract from S cells was treated with RNase, DNase, or protease, and then mixed with R cells
- Only treatment of the DNA extract from S cells with DNase destroyed the ability of the extract to transform the R cells

1) Mix R cells and DNA extract from S cells (treated or untreated)
2) Provide time for DNA to be taken up by R cells and for transformation cells to form a capsule
3) Add antibodies that cause untransformed R cells to aggregate
4) Gently centrifuge to remove aggregated R cells, leaving only S cells formed by transformation
5) Plate sample of mixture and incubate
## DNA as Genetic Material - Proof with Radioactivity Experiments
- Hershey and Chase (1952)
- Used bacteriophage T2 infection as model
- DNA labeled with $^{23}P$ protein coat labeled with $^{35}S$
- Only DNA entered cell but both new DNA and protein coats synthesized in new viruses indicating DNA had genetic information for both of these viral components

- In both experiments, phage progeny were produced, blender treatment did not interfere with the infection process
- _E. coli_ was infected with T2 phage containing $^{35}S$ protein after centrifugation most of the radioactivity remained in the supernatant (location of sheared-off phage particles)
- When a T2 phage containing $^{32}S$ DNA was mixed with the host bacterium, after centrifugation the radioactive DNA was in the pellet (location of cells)
- DNA was carrying the virus's genetic information
