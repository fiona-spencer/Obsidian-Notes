# 13.1 - Experiments Using Bacterial and Viruses Demonstrated that DNA is the Genetic Material

## Griffith's Transformation Experiments

- Once thought that DNA was too simple a molecule to store genetic information
	- Only 4 different nucleotide
- Argued that proteins, being composed of 20 amino acids, where a better candidate for cellular function
- Fred Griffith (1928) studying the transfer of virulence in pathogen _Streptococcus penumoniae_, called pneumococcus

## Experiments Demonstrated that a Cellular Component Transformed Non-pathogenic Bacteria into Pathogenic Bacteria

![](Pasted%20image%2020250528162547.png)

- Mice dies of pneumonia when inhected with pathogenic strains of pneumococci, which have a capsule and form smooth-looking colonies (S strain)
- Mice survived when injected with non-pathogenic strains of pneumococci, which lack a capsule and form rough colonies (R strain)
- Injection with heat-killed S strains had no effect
- Injection with a live R strain and heat-killed S strain gave the mice pneumonia, and live S strain penumococci could be isolated form the dead mice

## Griffith's Transformation Experiments
- When he injected a combination of killed virulent bacteria and a living non-virulent strain, the mice died
	- He could recover living virulent bacteria from dead mice
- Griffith called this change of non-virulent bacteria into virulent pathogens, _transformation_

## Transformation Principle
- Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1944) showed that the transforming principle was DNNA
- Transformation of non-virulent bacteria was blocked only if DNase treated
- To demonstrate that contaminating molecules in the DNA extract were not responsible for transformation, the DNA extract from S cells was treated with RNase, DNase, or protease, and then mixed with R cells
- Only treatment of the DNA extract from S cells with DNase destroyed the ability of the extract to transform the R cells

![](Pasted%20image%2020250528163055.png)

1) Mix R cells and DNA extract from S cells (treated or untreated)
2) Provide time for DNA to be taken up by R cells and for transformation cells to form a capsule
3) Add antibodies that cause untransformed R cells to aggregate
4) Gently centrifuge to remove aggregated R cells, leaving only S cells formed by transformation
5) Plate sample of mixture and incubate
## DNA as Genetic Material - Proof with Radioactivity Experiments
- Hershey and Chase (1952)
- Used bacteriophage T2 infection as model
- DNA labeled with $^{23}P$ protein coat labeled with $^{35}S$
- Only DNA entered cell but both new DNA and protein coats synthesized in new viruses indicating DNA had genetic information for both of these viral components

![](Pasted%20image%2020250528163542.png)

- In both experiments, phage progeny were produced, blender treatment did not interfere with the infection process
- _E. coli_ was infected with T2 phage containing $^{35}S$ protein after centrifugation most of the radioactivity remained in the supernatant (location of sheared-off phage particles)
- When a T2 phage containing $^{32}S$ DNA was mixed with the host bacterium, after centrifugation the radioactive DNA was in the pellet (location of cells)
- DNA was carrying the virus's genetic information

# 5 - Eukaryotic Cell Structure

---

## Red Means Dead

- Over half of the commercial lodgepole pine trees have been killed
	- Mountain pine beetle and its symbiont _Grosmannia clavigera_
- They kill via a mutualistic relationship
- The beetle chews through the bark and the fungus (located on the beetle's mouth parts) is able to degrade the protective resin toxin that the tree releases

- The beetle is now protected and continue it's attack on the tree, ultimately laying eggs, and spreading fungus deep into the tree
- The fungus, now deep in the tree, produces mass amounts of filaments and clogs the tress circulatory system ultimately killing it

## Eukaryotic Microorganisms

- Prominent members of ecosystems
- Useful as model systems and in industrial microbiology
- 2 groups of eukaryotes
	- Protists
	- Fungi
- Some are major human pathogens
- Eukaryotes have membrane-delimited nuclei, and membranes play a prominent part in the structure of many other organelles

# 5.1 - Eukaryotic cells are Diverse But Share Some Common Features

---


## Microbes within the domain Eukarya

Protists - generally larger than _Bacteria_ and _Archaea_
- Algae - photosynthetic (diatomes)
- Protozoa - may be motile, "hunters, grazers"
- Slime molds - two life cycle stages
- Water mold - devastating disease in plants
Fungi
- Yeast - unicellualr
- Molds and mushrooms - multicellular


## Eukaryotic Microorganisms



## Common Features of Eukaryotic Cell Organization

- Membrane-delimited nuclei
- Membrane-bound organelles that perform specific functions analogous to the functions of organs in the body of a multicellular organism
- Intracytoplasmic membrane complex serves as transport system to move material throughout the cell


## Common Features of Eukaryotic Cells

Shape and size
- Morphologically diverse to adapt to environments
- Typically larger than bacterial and archaea cell
	- Large and small extremes do exist


## Structure of 2 Representative Eukaryotic Microbes

- 

## Roel of Membranes

- Placement of different cellular functions in separate compartments so that they can more easily take place simultaneously under independent control and proper coordination
- Large membrane surface make possible greater respiratory and photosynthetic activity because these processes are located exclusively in membrane
- Intracytoplasmic membrane complex also serves as a transport system to move materials between different cell locations
- Abundant membrane systems probably necessary in eukaryotic cells because of their large volume and the need for adequate regulation, metabolic activity, and transport


# 6 - Viruses, Acellular, Infectious Agents

--- 

## Viruses Do More than Cause Disease
- There are other important uses
	- Viral members of the aquatic ecosystem
	- Move organic matter from particulate to dissolved
	- Can be used to destroy cancer cells
	- Importance as a new source of therapy
	- Bacteriophages in human guts may regulate bacterial microbiome


# 6.1 - Viruses are Acellular

---

## Acellular Agents

**Viruses** - protein and nucleic acid (the term virion is used to describe the complete, infective form of a virus outside a host cell, with a core of RNA or DNA and a capsid)

**Viroids** - only RNA

**Satellites** - only nucleic acid and need a helper virus to replicate

**Prions** - proteins only

## Viruses

**Virology** - the study of viruses

**Viruses** - infectious agents unique in their simple, acellular organization and pattern of multiplication
- Major causes of disease
- Important model system in molecular biology

## Extracellular or Intracellular Viruses

- Extracellular viruses
	- Inactive
	- Cannot reproduce outside of living cells
- Intracellular viruses
	- Commandeer host cells and use them to synthesize viral components from which mature progeny viruses are assembled and released

## Viruses Can Infect All Cell Types
- Most are eukaryotic viruses
- Infect plants, animals, protists, and fungi
- Few archaeal viruses has been identified

**Bacteriophages (phages)** - infect bacteria

# 6.2 - Virion Structure Is Defined by Capsid Symmettry and Presence or Absence of an Envelope

---

## The Structure of Viruses

**Virion** - mature virus particle
- Virons range in size
- 20 nm in diameter
- Size of rod-shaped bacteria cell (1.5 x 0m5 $\micro$m)

Contents
**Nucleocapsid** - composed of nucleic (DNA or RNA) and a protein coat (capsid)
**Enveloped viruses** - lipid membrane
**Non-enveloped viruses** - naked virus

## Size and Virion Morphology of Selected Viruses

- SARS-CoV-2 approximately 50-200 nm in diameter
- Enveloped virus containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of protein
- The envelope bears club-shaped glycoprotein projections

## Capsids

- Large macromolecular structures which serve as protein coat of virus
- Made of many copies of one type of protein and a few minor proteins
	- Identical protein subunit are called protomers
- Protect viral genetic material and aid in its transfer between host cells
- Non-enveloped viruses construct a capsid
	- Capsid is constructed rom many copies of one protein
- Enveloped viruses require nucleocapsid proteins and extra proteins to anchor to the membrane
- Capsids are helical, icosahedral, or complex

## Helical Capsides

- Shaped like hollow tubes with protein walls
- Protomers self assemble into rigid tube
- Size of capsid is influenced by promoters and genome

## Icosahedral Capsids

- Most efficient way to enclose a space
- An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 equilateral triangular faces and 12 vertices

**Capsomers** - ring or knob-shaped units made of 5 or 6 protomers
- Pentamers (pentons) - 5 promoter capsomers
- Hexamers (hexons) - 6 promoters capsomers

## Capsids of Complex Symmetry


- Some viruses do not fit into the category of having helical or isosahedral capsids
	- Poxviruses
		- Largest of the animal viruses
		- Complex interior and ovoid- to -brick shaped exterior
	- Large bacteriophages
		- Binal symmetry (head, resembles icosahedral tail is helical)

## Phages: An Example of Complex Capsid Symmetry
## Viral Envelopes and Enzymes


- Many viruses are bound by an outer, flexible, membranous layer called an envelope
- Animal virus envelopes (lipid and carbohydrates) usually arise from host cell plasma or organelle membranes


## Viral Envelope Proteins

- Envelope proteins, which are viral encoded, may project from the envelope surface as spikes or peplomers
	- Spikes involved in viral attachment to host cell
	- Surface proteins can have enzymatic activity needed for entry or exit from host cell
	- Used for identification of virus

## Viral Genomes Are Structurally Diverse


- A virus may have single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA
- The size of viral genome varies
	- 4,000 to 2 M nucleotides

# 6.3 - Viral Life Cycles Have Five Steps

---

## Viral Multiplication
## Attachment (Adsorption)

- Viruses require a host cell in which to multiply
- Ligand (on virion) attaches to a receptor (on host)
	- SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the viral ligand that attaches to the human receptor called ACE2
- Receptor determines host preference
	- **Tropism** - viruses will bind to specific tissue receptors
- In plants, no receptors have been found, instead damage of the host cell is required for entry
- After attachment, the virus's genome or entire nucleocapsid entry the cytoplasm
- In some cases, only the genome enters leaving the capsid attached to the outer of the cell
- Other times, the genome is still enclosed
- 3 methods used
	- Fusion of the viral envelope with host cell's plasma membrane
	- Endocytosis
	- Release of nucleic acid

## Entry Into the Host
## Animal Virus Entry
## Synthesis

- This is the step that differs the most between viruses
- Genome dictates the events

## Assembly

- Late proteins are involved in assembly
- Assembly process in complex
- Baseplate, tail fibers, and head components of bacteriophage T4 are assembled separately

## Virion Release Mechanisms

2 Mechanisms
- Host cell lysis (non-enveloped viruses)
- Release by budding (enveloped viruses)

# 6.6 - Viroids and Satellites: Nucleic Acid-Based Sub-viral Agents

---

## Viroids

- Simple infectious agent that consists only of RNA
	- Closed, circular ssRNA
- Do not encode any proteins
- Replication requires host cell
- Cause plant disease
	- RNA silencing

## Satellites

- Infectious nucleic acids (DNA or RNA)
- Nucleic acids enclosed in capsid and need a helper virus to replicate
- Satellites encode own capsid proteins but rely on helper virus for replication enzymes
- Most satellites use plants viruses as their helper viruses

# 6.7 - Prions Are Composed Only of Proteins
## Prions - Proteinaceous Infectious Particle

- Made of only single protein
- Cause a variety of neurodegenerative disease in humans and animals
	- Scrapie in sheep
	- Bovine sprongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease"
	- Human diseases Kuru, fatal familial insomnia, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, and Gerstmann-Strassler-Scheinker syndrom
