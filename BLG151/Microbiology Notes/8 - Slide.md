# 13.2 - Nucleic Acid and Protein Structure

## DNA and RNA Structure

- The nucleic acids, DNA, and RNA, are polymers of nucleotides
- Linked together by phosphodiester bonds
- DNA and RNA differ
	- Nitrogenous bases
	- Sugars
	- Single or double stranded

## DNA Structure

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602182035.png)

- Polymer (chain of monomer) of DNA
- Bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine
- Sugar is deoxyribose
- Phosphodiester bond - phosphate is esterified to sugar carbon
- Sugar phosphate backbone
- Covalent bond between the 3'-hydroxyl of one sugar and a 5'-phosphate attached to an adjacent sugar

## DNA Structure - Two Complementary Strands

- Molecule is double-stranded helix
- Complementary base pairing
	- Adenine (purine) and thymine (pyrimidine) pair by 2 hydrogen bonds
	- Guanine (purine) and cytosine (pyrimidine) pair by 3 hydrogen bond
- Major and minor grooves form when the 2 strands twist around each other

A -> T
C -> G

## DNA Double Helix


![](Pasted%20image%2020250602182418.png)

## DNA Supercoiling

- DNA is helical, forming a coil
- Supercoiling "loosens" up the DNA, making it easier to separate the two strands for DNA replication and transcription

2 Forms:
- Positive
	- Increases the number of base pairs per turn
- Negative
	- Decreases the number of base pairs per turn


## RNA Structure

- Polymer of ribonucleotide
- Base (A, G, C, and U)
- Sugar ribose
- Phosphodiester bonds
- Most RNA molecules single stranded, some double stranded

## Amino Acid Structure

- Amino acids have a central carbon with an attached proton, carboxyl group (C-terminus, 3'), amino group (N-terminus, 5'), and a side chain
- Amino acids can be polar, non-polar, or charged depending on side chains

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602182739.png)

## Protein Structure

- Polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds between carbon and nitrogen
- A tetrapeptide is a short chain of 4 amino acids linked together by peptide bonds
- Each peptide bond links the caryboxyl gruop (-COOH) of one amino acid to the amino group (-$NH_2$) of the next

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602182918.png)


## Levels of Protein Structure

- Proteins have 3D structures that are determined by the amino acids in the polypeptide

Primary structure - amino acid sequence
Secondary structure - alpha helices or beta sheets
Tertiary structure - 3D structure
Quaternary structure - 2 or more polypeptide strands interacting

# 13.3 - DNA Replication in Bacteria

## RNA Replication

- Complex process involving numerous proteins which help ensure accuracy
- Involved initiation of replication, strand separation, assembly of DNA replication machinery at the replication fork, the polymerase reaction (synthesis of a new DNA strand) and termination
- The 2 DNA strands separate, each serving as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand
- Synthesis is semi-conservative
	- Each daughter cell obtains one old and one new strand

## Semi-conservative DNA Replication

- DNA replication is semi-conservative
	- Each of the 2 new DNA molecules consists of one newly synthesized strand and one old strand
	- Preserves the sequence of the bases
	- Error rate: about 1 in every $10^{-9}$ or $10^{-10}$
- Rapid, ~750 to 1000 base pairs per second in bacteria, ~100 pairs per second in eukaryotes

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602183532.png)

## Bidirectional, Semi-conservative Replication of DNA

- DNA in most bacteria is circular
- Plasmids, are circular DNA in bacteria and archaea
- Bidirectional from a origin of replication (oriC)
- Replication fork is where DNA is unwound
- The initiatory protein, DnaA, bonds to OriC, multiple DnaAs from a filament that separates the dsDNA (the replication bubble)
- DNA synthesis occurs at the replication forks


![](Pasted%20image%2020250602183726.png)

## Bidirectional DNA Replication

**Replicon** - a portion of the genome that contains an origin and is replicated as a unit (in bacteria the whole chromosome is a replicon)
- 2 replication forks proceed in opposite directions from the origin, copying the replicon, until they meet at replication termination site (ter)
- 2 separate chromosomes are released
- Parental and two new strands
- A theta structure is an intermediate observed in the process


### Bacteria Replication Machinery

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602184028.png)

## DNA Replication Initiation

**Replisome** - 12 proteins involved in replication
- 2 replisomes move in either direction away from the origin

**Helicase** - ring encircles DNA, disrupts H-bonds and provides force to move the replisome

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602184222.png)


## Replication Machinery - Polymerases

- DNA polymerases, within replisome, synthesize DNA complementary strand
- DNA synthesis proceeds in 5' to 3' direction forming phosphodiester bonds between deoxyribonucleoside trophosphates (dNTPs) - deoxynucleotides added to the growing strand

Polymerases require:
- **A template** - the parental DNA strain (read in 3' to 5' direction), directs synthesis of complementary strand
- **A primer** - a short RNA strand to provide a free 3'-hydroxyl group (-OH) from the growing strand to which nucleotides can be added
- **Primase** - RNA polymerase synthesizes a short RNA molecule (primer, ~10 nucleotides) complementary to the DNA template
- **dNTPs** - 


- RNA polymerases can synthesize RNA without a free 3'-OH
- The multi-protein complex

## DNA Polymerase Reaction

- dNTPs are linked by phosphodiester bonds between the hydroxyl group at the 3' end of the growing strand and the phosphate closest to the 5'C of the incoming dNTP (alpha phosphate)
	- DNA polymerase catalyze DNA synthesis in the 5; to 3' direction
- dNTPs

## Replication Machinery - The Polymerase Pieces

- _E. coli_ has 5 DNA polymerases with polymerase III playing the major role in replication
- DNA polymerase III holoenzyme - complex of 3 core enzymes (each composed of 3 different proteins)

## DNA Polymerase Reaction

- The h

## Other Replisome Proteins

- The energy that fuels the DNA polymerase reaction come from the hydrolysis of the nucleotide's triphosphate group
- The 3' -OH of the growing DNA strand performs a nucleophilic attach on the $\alpha$-phosphate of the incoming dNTP

## DNA Replication Proteins in

**DNaB Helicases** - responsible for separating the tow strands of parental DNA
- Strands are kept apart by single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB), which allows for synthesis of an RNA primer by DNA primase
- DNA gyrase eases the strain introduces into the DNA double helix by helicase activity


- DNA polmerases synthesis DNA in the 5' to 3' direction
	- Continuous DNA synthesis of the leading strand
- The lagging strand cannot be extending in the same direction as replication fork since no free 3'-OH
	- Discontinuous synthesis
	- Okazaki fragments

- A new RNA primer is required for the synthesis of each Okazaki fragment

**Primase** - synthesizes short complementary strands of RNA primers (~10 nucleotides) needed by DNA polymerase

## Events at the Replication Fork


## Linking the Fragments

**DNA ligase** - forms a phosphodiester bond between 3'-OH of growing strand and 5'-phosphate of an Okazaki fragment

## Proofreading

- Carried out by DNA polymerase III
- Removal of mismatched base from 3' end of growing strand by exonuclease activity of enzyme
- This activity is not 100% efficient

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602185919.png)

## Termination of Replication in _E. coli_

- Replication stops when replisome reaches termination site on DNA

**Catenanes** - from when topoisomerases break and rejoin DNA strands to ease supercoiling
- Recombinase enzymes catalyze an intramolecular crossover that separates the 2 chromosomes
- Topoisomerases temporarily break the DNA molecules so the strands can separate

# 13.4 - Bacterial Genes Consist of Coding Regions and Other Sequences Important for Gene Function

## Genes Encode Different Products

- The basic unit of genetic information, defined as the nucleic acid sequence that codes for a polypeptide (via mRNA), tRNA or rRNA
- Linear sequence of nucleotide with a fixed start point and end point
- Codons are found in mRNA and code for single amino acids
- Transcription yields 3 types of RNA molecules

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602190302.png)


## Transcription Yields 3 Major Types of Molecules

1) Messenger RNA (mRNA)
	1) Molecules arise from transcription of protein-coding genes
	2) They are translated into protein with the aid of two other types of RNA
2) Transfer RNA (tRNA)
	1) Molecules carry amino acids to the ribosomes during translation
3) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
	1) Molecules have several functions, including catalyzing peptide bond formation


## Protein-Coding Genes

**Template strand** - DNA direct mRNA synthesis
- Reads in the 3' to 5' direction
- Complementary DNA strand (sense strand)
- Same nucleotide sequence as mRNA (except in DNA bases)

- The cell organization of a typical structural gene in bacteria cell
- Only one DNA strand of a gene is transcribed into mRNA sytneshsi
- The template (anti-sense) strand of DNA, read in the 3' to 5' direction, directs RNA. synthesis
- Messenger RNA is a product of the gene in part A
- First nucleotide incorporated into mRNA is usually GMP or AMP
- Translation of the mRNA begins with the AUG start codon

## Gene Structure

**Promoter**

- The transcription state site (1+) is the first nucleotide in the mRNA transcribed from the gene
- Leader sequence is transcribed into mRNA but it not translated into amino acids
- Contains the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, initiation of translation

Coding Region
- Begins with the sequence 3'-TAC-5'

## tRNA and rRNA Transcription

- DNA sequences that code for tRNA and rRNA are considered genes
- Actively growing cells need a ready supply of tRNA and rRNA
- More than one gene codes for a single type of tRNA
- Genes coding for tRNA and rRNA are transcribed from single promoter
	- Controls amount of tRNA and rRNA in the cell
- When more than one tRNA is transcribed form a promoter, they are separated by a short spacer sequences



# 13.5 - Transcription in Bacteria

## Transcription

- RNA synthesis from DNA template
- RNA produced has complementary sequence to the template DNA

3 Types of RNA are produced
1. mRNA carries the message from protein sytneshis
2. rRNA carries amino acids during protein synthesis
3. rRNA molecules are components of ribosomes

## Operon

- Bacterial genes encoding proteins involved in related processes are transcribed by a single promoter
- Not common in eukaryotes (moncistronic)
- Transcription yield mRNA consisting of a leading, one coding region, a spacer and a second coding region
- Polycistronic mRNA, often found in bacteria and archaea

## Bacterial RNA Polymerases Consist of 5 Different Proteins

- Core enzyme composed of 5 polypeptides (two $\alpha$-subunits, $\beta$, $\beta'$ and $\omega$) catalyzes RNA synthesis
- The sigma factor ($\sigma$) has no catalytic activity but helps the core enzyme recognize the start of genes

## The Transcription Cycle in Bacteria

- The transcription factor sigma is critical to the initiation process
- As part of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, it helps position at the promoter

## Sigma Promoter

- Sigma factor helps position the core enzyme at the promoter

**Promoter** - site where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription (it is not transcribed)

- 35 basepairs upstream (TTGACA)
	- Sigma factor recognizes this sequence directing haloenzyme to "settle" here
- 10 basepairs upstream (TATAAT)
	- Where RNA strands start to separate

## Initiation of Transcription in Bacteria
## The Transcription Cycle in Bacteria

- After binding, RNA polymerase unwinds/denatures (~16-20bp) DNA (2); transcription bubble
- Bubble moves with the polymerase as it synthesizes mRNA from template strand (in 2, red line) during the elongation step
- Within the bubble a temporary RNA, DNA hydrid is formed (3)

## Transcription Elongation

- After binding, RNA polymerase unwinds DNA

Transcription bubble
- Move with the polymerase as it synthesizes mRNA



## The Transcription Cycle In Bacteria

- Elongation continues until a terminator is encountered
- RNA polymerase will cease transcription and release the RNA

## Transcription Termination

- Occurs when core RNA polymerase dissociates from template DNA
Termination mechanisms
- Intrinsic termination
- Factor-dependent


1) DNA sequences mark the end of gene in the terminator region
2) Some terminators require the aid of the rho factor for termination

# 13.6 - The Genetic Code Consists of Three-Letter "Words"
## The Genetic Code - Example of Gene to mRNA to Protein

- Translation is the final step in expression of protein encoding genes
- mRNA is read in discrete sets of 3 nucleotides (codons, each encoding an amino acid) and translated into amino acid sequence of polypeptide chain
- During transcription, mRNA complementary to the template strand of DNA is synthesized
- The first translated codon is the start codon
- Codes from initiator rRNA and established the reading frame (the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain that is made from mRNA)
- An anti-codon (a 3-nucleotide sequence found on tRNA) binds to the corresponding mRNA sequence

## Organization of the Code

Codon
- 3 nucleotides that specify a single amino acid
- Reading frame is how its "read"

Start Codon
- Start site for translation
- Always AUG

Stop (non-sense) codons
- The codons are translation termination (UGA, UAG, and UAA)
- Do not encode amino acids

Sense codons
- The 61 codons that specify amino acids

Code degeneracy
- Up to six different codons can code for a single amino acid

## The Genetic Code

- Because DNA consists of 4 different bases, and there are 3 bases in a codon

$4^3 = 64$

- Therefore, 64 possible combinations for a codon
- Only 3 code for stop
- 61 aa codons

- There are only 20 possible amino acids, redundancy, several different codons can encode for the same amino acid

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602194153.png)

## Wobble

- Loose base pairing
- 3rd position of codon less important that 1st and 2nd
- Eliminates need for unique tRNA for each codon
- Decreases effect of some mutation
- The use of wobble in coding for the amino acid glycine: wobble decreases the $ of tRNAs needed
- Because of wobble, G in the 5' position of the anticodon (tRNA) can pair with either C or U in the 3' position of the codon
- Two codons can be recognized by the same tRNA

## Exceptions to the Code


- Exceptions present in organelles or organisms with reduced genomes
- Mycoplasma uses stop codon (UGA) to code for glutamine
- Some microbes incoprorate two rare amino acids into polypeptides (selenocystine, members of all 3 domains of life)
- Some protists use a single stop codon, the other two code for amino acids instead

# 13.7 - Translation In Bacteria

## Translation

- Synthesis of polypeptide direction by sequence by nucleotides in mRNA at ribosomes
	- Direction of synthesis N terminal -> C-terminal
	- Polypeptide synthesis begins with the amino acid at the end of the chain with a free amino group -the N-terminal and moves in the C-terminal direction
- Translation begins with a ribosomes binds mRNA and is positioned properly to that translation will yield correct amino acid sequence in the polypeptide chain
- tRNA molecules carry amino acids to the ribosome so that they can be added to the polypeptide chain as the ribosome moves down the mRNA molecule

- Protein synthesis is accurate and rapid
- _E. coli_, synthesis occurs at a rate of at least 900 amino acids added per minute

## Transfer RNA Structure

- 70-95 nucleotides
- Base pairing within the tRNA molecules form cloverleaf structure with forls into an L-shape structure

Anticodon
- Complementary to the mRNA codon
- Located on the anticodon

- The two-dimensional cloverleaf structure tRNA
- In addition to the anticodon arm, three other arms are readily observed
- The D and T arms have unusual nucleotides
- The variable arm is of different lengths depending on the tRNA
- The other arms are fairly constant in size


## Amino Acid Activation

- Attachment of amino acid to tRNA acceptor stem

Aminoacyl-rRNA synthetases
- Catalyze amino acid actication
- At least 20 amino-acyl tRNA synthetases, each specific for a single amino acid
- tRNAs attaches to a specific amino acid (cognate tRNAs)

## The Ribosome

- The ribosomes is divided into 2 functional domains

1. Translational
2. Exit domain

- Both subunits contribute
