# 13.2 - Nucleic Acid and Protein Structure

## DNA and RNA Structure

- The nucleic acids, DNA, and RNA, are polymers of nucleotides
- Linked together by phosphodiester bonds
- DNA and RNA differ
	- Nitrogenous bases
	- Sugars
	- Single or double stranded

## DNA Structure

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602182035.png)

- Polymer (chain of monomer) of DNA
- Bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine
- Sugar is deoxyribose
- Phosphodiester bond - phosphate is esterified to sugar carbon
- Sugar phosphate backbone
- Covalent bond between the 3'-hydroxyl of one sugar and a 5'-phosphate attached to an adjacent sugar

## DNA Structure - Two Complementary Strands

- Molecule is double-stranded helix
- Complementary base pairing
	- Adenine (purine) and thymine (pyrimidine) pair by 2 hydrogen bonds
	- Guanine (purine) and cytosine (pyrimidine) pair by 3 hydrogen bond
- Major and minor grooves form when the 2 strands twist around each other

A -> T
C -> G

## DNA Double Helix


![](Pasted%20image%2020250602182418.png)

## DNA Supercoiling

- DNA is helical, forming a coil
- Supercoiling "loosens" up the DNA, making it easier to separate the two strands for DNA replication and transcription

2 Forms:
- Positive
	- Increases the number of base pairs per turn
- Negative
	- Decreases the number of base pairs per turn


## RNA Structure

- Polymer of ribonucleotide
- Base (A, G, C, and U)
- Sugar ribose
- Phosphodiester bonds
- Most RNA molecules single stranded, some double stranded

## Amino Acid Structure

- Amino acids have a central carbon with an attached proton, carboxyl group (C-terminus, 3'), amino group (N-terminus, 5'), and a side chain
- Amino acids can be polar, non-polar, or charged depending on side chains

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602182739.png)

## Protein Structure

- Polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds between carbon and nitrogen
- A tetrapeptide is a short chain of 4 amino acids linked together by peptide bonds
- Each peptide bond links the caryboxyl gruop (-COOH) of one amino acid to the amino group (-$NH_2$) of the next

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602182918.png)


## Levels of Protein Structure

- Proteins have 3D structures that are determined by the amino acids in the polypeptide

Primary structure - amino acid sequence
Secondary structure - alpha helices or beta sheets
Tertiary structure - 3D structure
Quaternary structure - 2 or more polypeptide strands interacting

# 13.3 - DNA Replication in Bacteria

## RNA Replication

- Complex process involving numerous proteins which help ensure accuracy
- Involved initiation of replication, strand separation, assembly of DNA replication machinery at the replication fork, the polymerase reaction (synthesis of a new DNA strand) and termination
- The 2 DNA strands separate, each serving as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand
- Synthesis is semi-conservative
	- Each daughter cell obtains one old and one new strand

## Semi-conservative DNA Replication

- DNA replication is semi-conservative
	- Each of the 2 new DNA molecules consists of one newly synthesized strand and one old strand
	- Preserves the sequence of the bases
	- Error rate: about 1 in every $10^{-9}$ or $10^{-10}$
- Rapid, ~750 to 1000 base pairs per second in bacteria, ~100 pairs per second in eukaryotes

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602183532.png)

## Bidirectional, Semi-conservative Replication of DNA

- DNA in most bacteria is circular
- Plasmids, are circular DNA in bacteria and archaea
- Bidirectional from a origin of replication (oriC)
- Replication fork is where DNA is unwound
- The initiatory protein, DnaA, bonds to OriC, multiple DnaAs from a filament that separates the dsDNA (the replication bubble)
- DNA synthesis occurs at the replication forks


![](Pasted%20image%2020250602183726.png)

## Bidirectional DNA Replication

**Replicon** - a portion of the genome that contains an origin and is replicated as a unit (in bacteria the whole chromosome is a replicon)
- 2 replication forks proceed in opposite directions from the origin, copying the replicon, until they meet at replication termination site (ter)
- 2 separate chromosomes are released
- Parental and two new strands
- A theta structure is an intermediate observed in the process


### Bacteria Replication Machinery

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602184028.png)

## DNA Replication Initiation

**Replisome** - 12 proteins involved in replication
- 2 replisomes move in either direction away from the origin

**Helicase** - ring encircles DNA, disrupts H-bonds and provides force to move the replisome

![](Pasted%20image%2020250602184222.png)


## Replication Machinery - Polymerases

- DNA polymerases, within replisome, synthesize DNA complementary strand
- DNA synthesis proceeds in 5' to 3' direction forming phosphodiester bonds between deoxyribonucleoside trophosphates (dNTPs) - deoxynucleotides added to the growing strand

Polymerases require:
- **A template** - the parental DNA strain (read in 3' to 5' direction), directs synthesis of complementary strand
- **A primer** - a short RNA strand to provide a free 3'-hydroxyl group (-OH) from the growing strand to which nucleotides can be added
- **Primase** - RNA polymerase synthesizes a short RNA molecule (primer, ~10 nucleotides) complementary to the DNA template
- **dNTPs** - 


- RNA polymerases can synthesize RNA without a free 3'-OH
- The multi-protein complex

## DNA Polymerase Reaction

- dNTPs are linked by phosphodiester bonds between the hydroxyl group at the 3' end of the growing strand and the phosphate closest to the 5'C of the incoming dNTP (alpha phosphate)
	- DNA polymerase catalyze DNA synthesis in the 5; to 3' direction
- dNTPs

## Replication Machinery - The Polymerase Pieces

- _E. coli_ has 5 DNA polymerases with polymerase III playing the major role in replication
- DNA polymerase III holoenzyme - complex of 3 core enzymes (each composed of 3 different proteins)

## DNA Polymerase Reaction

- The h

## Other Replisome Proteins

- The energy that fuels the DNA polymerase reaction come from the hydrolysis of the nucleotide's triphosphate group
- The 3' -OH of the growing DNA strand performs a nucleophilic attach on the $\alpha$-phosphate of the incoming dNTP

## DNA Replication Proteins in

**DNaB Helicases** - responsible for separating the tow strands of parental DNA
- Strands are kept apart by single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB), which allows for synthesis of an RNA primer by DNA primase
- DNA gyrase eases the strain introduces into the DNA double helix by helicase activity

## Events at the Replication Fork

- DNA polmerases synthesis DNA in the 5' to 3' direction
	- Continuous DNA synthesis of the leading strand
- The lagging strand cannot be extending in the same direction as replication fork since no free 3'-OH
	- Discontinuous synthesis
	- Okazaki fragments

- A new RNA primar is required for the sy
