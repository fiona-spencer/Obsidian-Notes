# 8.1 - Microbial Growth and Replication: Targets for Control

## Common Microbial Control Methods

**Biocide** - Anti-microbial agents that control microorganisms
- Physical, chemical, mechanical, or biological


![](Pasted%20image%2020250528155405.png)


## Definition of Frequently Used Terms

**Sterilization** - process by which all living cells, spores, and acellular entities are destroyed or removed from an object
- Sterilant is the chemical agent

**Disinfection** - killing, inhibition, or removal of disease-causing microorganisms

**Disinfectants** - agents, usually chemical, used for disinfection, usually on inanimate objects
- Does not always sterilize as spores or a few organisms can remain

**Sanitization** - reduction of microbial population to levels deemed safe by public health standards

**Antisepsis** - destruction of microbes on living tissue
**Antiseptics** - chemical agents applied to tissue to kill or inhibit growth of pathogens


## Antimicrobial Agents

**Chemotherapy** - generic term that describes application of chemical to kill microorganisms
- Effective against a specific group
	- Bactericides, fungicides, viricides

**Static agents** - inhibit growth
- May be especially effective against a specific group
- Include bacteriostatic and fungistatic

## Impact of Biocide Exposure

- A biocide is a chemical or physical agent that inactivates microorganisms
- Three exponential plots of survivors vs. time of biocide exposure, indicating the potential kinetics of biocide action
- Sterilization refers to the absence of viable organisms regardless of biocide kinetics

## Resistance to Biocides

- Resistance to antimicrobial biocides has been increasing similar to the rate of resistance of antibiotics
- Mechanisms to resistance similar to antibiotic resistance
	- Efflux pumps
	- Alter membrane permeability
	- Modify the target
	- Specific resistance genes
## Pattern of Microbial Death Mirrors the Pattern of Microbial Growth

- Microorganisms are not killed instantly when exposed to lethal agents
- Population death occurs exponentially
	- Reduces by the same fraction at constant intervals

**Decimal reduction time** - time required to kill 90% of microorganisms
$D_{value}$ - time required to drop by 10-fold
$Z_{value}$ - temperature change that decreases the microbial population by 90%

## D and Z Values

- The pattern of microbial death

# 8.2 - Microbes Can Be Controlled by Physical Means
## Filtration

- Reduces microbial population in heat sensitive materials by removing microorganisms
- Also used to reduce microbial populations in air

**Depth filter** - fibrous materials that have been bonded into a thick layer filled with narrow, twisting channels
- Solution with microbes is sucked through the layer under vacuum and microbes absorb to the surface of the filter material

![](Pasted%20image%2020250528160122.png)

**Membrane filter sterilization** - liquid to be sterilized is pumped through a membrane filter and into a sterile container
- Uses a vacuum pump to force liquid through the filter
- Cross section of filter and its pores, are too small formicrobes to pas through

## Filtering Liquids

Membrane Filters
- Porous membranes with defined pores sizes that remove microorganisms
- Often used after a depth filter

## Filtering Air

- Surgical masks
	- N95 disposable mask
	- Excludes 95% of particles
- High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters
	- Used in laminar flow biological safety cabinets
	- Exclude 99.97% of particles
	- During COVID-19 pandemic, airlines showed this filter to be effective

![](Pasted%20image%2020250528160319.png)

## Moist Heat

- Destroys viruses, fungi, and bacteria by degrading nucleic acids, denaturing proteins, and disrupting cell membranes
- Boiling will not destroy endospores and does not sterilize
- Can be used to disinfect drinking water

![](Pasted%20image%2020250528160357.png)


## Steam Sterilization

Autoclave
- Device used in steam sterilization
- 100C which requires saturated steam under pressure
- Effective against all types of microorganisms, including spores
Quality control
- _Geobacillus stearothermophilus_ strips or colour changing tape



## Pasteurization

- Controlled heating at temperatures well below boiling
- Used for milk, wine, and other beverages
- Process does not sterilize, but does kill pathogens and slows spoilage by reducing the total load of organisms present
## Tyndallization

- For materials that cannot withstand the high temperatures of autoclave
- Intermittent sterilization
	- 30 to 60 min of steam exposure with 23 to 24 hours between incubations
	- 2 to 3 time repeated

## Dry Heat Sterilization

- Less effective than moist heat sterilization, requiring higher temperatures and longer exposure time
	- Items subjected to 160 to 170C for 2 to 3 hours
	- 
## Dry Heat Incineration

- Bench top incinerators are used to sterilize inoculating loops used in microbiology labs

## UV (Ultraviolet) Radiation

- Wavelength of 260 nm
- Most lethal
- Cause thymine dimers
- UV limited to surface sterilization because cannot penetrate glass, dirt films, water, and other substances
- Has been used to treat water

## Ionizing Radiation

- Gamma radiation penetrates deep into objects
- Dislodges electron from atoms or molecules, producing chemically reactive free radicals
- Used for sterilization and pasteurization of antibiotics, hormones, sutures, plastic disposable supplies, and food

# 8.3 - Microorganisms Are Controlled with Chemical Agengs

## Chemical Agents and Their Requirements

**Phenolics** - organic compound characterized by having a hydroxyl group (-OH) directly bonded to a carbon atom within an aromatic ring

**Alcohols** - organic compound containing a hydroxyl group (Oh) bonded to a saturated carbon atom

**Halogens (Iodine)** - 

- Skin antiseptic
- Acts by oxidizing cell consituents and iodinating proteins

**Halogens (Chlorine)** - 

- Acts by oxidizing cellular materials and destroys vegetative bacteria and fungi
- Important in disinfection of water supplies, swimming pools, and used in dairy and food industries
- Chlorine is a household disinfectant as well


**Metals** - 
- 



## Quaternary Ammonium Compounds
- Detergents that have a broad spectrum in antimicrobial activity and are effective disinfectant

**Detergents** - amphipathic organic cleansing agents

- Cationic detergents are effective disinfectants
- Kill most bacteria but not _M. tuberculosis_ or endospores
- Stable and nontoxic, but inactivated by hard water and soap

**Aldehydes**

## Effects of Glutaraldehyde

- Cross-linking

## Sterilizing Gases

- Used to sterilize heat-sensitive materials
- Microbicidal and sporicidal
- Ethylene oxide sterilization is carried out in equipment resembling an autoclave
- Vaporized hydrogen peroxide can also be used


# 8.4 - Anitmicrobial Agents Must Be Evaluated for Effectiveness

## Evaluation of Antimicrobial Agent Effectiveness

- Complex process regulated by US and Canadian federal agencies
- Environmental Protection Agency regulated disinfectants
- Food and Drug Administration regulated agents used on humans and animals
- Canadian Food Inpection Agency (CFIA) 

## Conditions Influencing the Effectiveness of Antimicrobial Agent Activity

Population size
- Larger populations take longer to kill than smaller population
Population composition
- Microorganisms differ markedly in their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents (endospores more resistant)
Concentration or intensity of an antimicrobial agent
- Usually higher concentration kill more rapidly
- Not a linear relationship, small changes can have a large effect
Contact Time
Temperature
Local environment
## Efficiency Evaluation of Chemical Agents

Phenol coefficient test
- Potency of a disinfectant in compared to that of phenol
- Useful for initial screening but may be misleading

Use dilution test
- Determines rate at which selected bacteria are destroyed by various chemical agents

Normal in-use testing
- Testing done using conditions that approximate normal used of disinfectant

# Microorganisms Can Be Controlled by Biological Methods

## Biological Control of Microorganims

- Emerging field
- Natural control mechanisms
	- Predation by _Bdellovibrio_
	- Viral-mediated lysis using pathogen specific bacteriophage lysins
- Bacteriophages
