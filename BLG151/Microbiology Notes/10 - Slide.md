# 11.1 - Metabolic Diversity and Nutritional Types

## Carbon Source

- Organisms require energy, electrons, and carbon
- Often together
- Carbon source provides H, O, and electrons
- Methods to gain carbon source
	- Heterotrophs
		- Use organic molecules as carbon sources
		- Can use a variety of carbon sources
	- Autotrophs
		- Use carbon dioxide as their sole or principal carbon source
		- Must obtain energy from other sources

## Nutritional Types of Organisms

- Based on energy source
	- **Phototrophs** - use light
	- **Chemotrophs** - obtain energy from oxidation of chemical compounds
- Based on electron source
	- **Litotrophs** - use reduced inorganic substances
	- **Organotrophs** - extract electrons from reduced organic compounds

## Sources of Energy, Electrons, and Carbon

Nutritional Types of Organisms
- Based on source
	- Energy
	- Electron
	- Carbon

## Fueling Reactions

- Despite diversity of energy, electron, and carbon sources used by organisms, they all generate 3 main products
	- **ATP** - used to conserve energy from an energy source
	- **Reducing power** - molecules that serve as a ready supply of electrons for chemical reactions
	- **Precursor metabolites** - provide carbon skeleton for biosynthesis of monomers

# 11.2 - There Are Two Chemoorganotrophic Fueling Processes

## A Few Definitions

**Phosphorylation (phos)**
- The addition of a PO_3 group to a molecule, vital for the cellular storage and transfer of free energy using electron carrier molecules (ATP)
- The conversion of ADP to ATP can occur through two kings of phosphorylation

**Oxidative phosphorylation (ox-phos)**
- Energy released during the oxidation of nutrients is used to drive phosphorylation reactions (= oxidation and phosphorylation are coupled)
- Energy is captured as electrons and transferred from electron donors to electron acceptors, such as oxygen, in a series of redox reactions through an electron transport chain
- This energy is used to generate PMF and power an ATP-synthesizing enzyme (ATP synthase)
- Also occurs during anaerobic respiration = the oxidation of organic or inorganic substrate for ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation using terminal e acceptors other than oxygen

**Substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP)**
- Does not couple phosphorylation with oxidation
- The free energy required for phosphorylation is provided by the chemical energy released when a higher energy substrate is converted into a lower energy product
- Occurs in the cytoplasm of cells (glycolysis) and during the Krebs (TCA) cycle
- Can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions

## Chemoorganotrophic Fueling Processes

- Use reduced organic compounds for catabolic and anabolic processes
- Also called chemoheterotrophs
- Processes used to catabolize energy source
	- Respiration
	- Fermentation

## Respiration

- Most respiration involved use of an electron transport chain
- Aerobic respiration - final electron acceptor is oxygen
- Anaerobic respiration - final electron acceptor is different oxidized molecule
- As electrons pass through the electron transport chain to the terminal electron acceptor, a proton motive force (PMF) is generated and used to synthesize ATP

## Chemoorganotrophic Fueling Processes

- Chemoorganotrophs, also called chemoheterotrophs, use reduced organic compounds for catabolic and anabolic processes using 2 major strategies
	1. Respiration
	2. Fermentation

- When organic compounds are oxidized, released electrons are accepted by e-carriers like FAD or NAD+
- Reduced electron carries (NADH or FADH) donate e's to an ECT -> respiration
	- In respiration reduced molecules are oxidized with O2 (aerobic respiration) or, in the absence of oxygen, using a different oxidized molecules like nitrate of sulfate (anaerobic respiration) as the TEA to generate e's for an ETC
	- The transport of e's through an ETC generate PMF
	- PMF is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi (ox phos); a small amount is made by SLP
	- NADH and FADH are reoxidized, can again accept and donate (to ETC) e's

- Fermentation does not use an ATC or an external TEA, uses an endogenous (from within the cells) TEA (usually an intermediate like pyruvate)
	- NADH is oxidized so that is can be reused
	- ATP is synthesized almost exclusively by SLP

### Respiration

- Electrons are donated to ETC
- PMF
- ATP synthesis by mostly by ox phos (oxidative phosphorylation)
- A small amount of ATP made by SLP (substrate level phosphorylation)

### Fermentation

- Uses an endogenous electron acceptor
- Electron acceptor is an intermediate of the pathway used to oxidize the organic energy source (pyruvate)
- Does not involved the use of an electron transport chain
- ATP synthesized only by SLP

## Fueling Reactions and Energy Sources

- Despite diversity of energy, electron, and carbon sources used by organisms, they all have the same basic needs
	- ATP as energy currency
	- Reducing power
	- Precursor metabolites for biosynthesis

## Energy Souces
- Wide variety of organic molecules used an energy sources
- Degradation pathways generate glucose of intermediates of the pathways used in glucose metabolism
- Ohly a few pathways
- Each breaks down many nutrients to increase metabolic efficiency


# 11.3 - Aerobic Respiration Starts with Glucose Oxidation


## Glucose Metabolism

- Respiration catabolized reduced organic energy source (such as glucose) to CO2 using glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle

Glucose catabolism (3 Steps)
1) Formation of pyruvate
2) Pyruvate is fed to TCA and oxidized to CO2, producing GTP, NADH, and FADH
3) NADH, and FADH are oxidized by ETC, using O2 as the terminal electron acceptor (aerobic)
4) Produces ATP (most of it indirectly via the activity of the electrons transport chian) and high energy electron carriers

## Glycolytic Pathways
