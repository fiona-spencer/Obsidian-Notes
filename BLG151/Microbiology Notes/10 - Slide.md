## Fueling Reactions

- Despite diversity of energy, electron, and carbon sources used by organisms, they all generate 3 main products
	- **ATP** - used to conserve energy from an energy source
	- **Reducing power** - molecules that serve as a ready supply of electrons for chemical reactions
	- **Precursor metabolites** - provide carbon skeleton for biosynthesis of monomers

# 11.2 - There Are Two Chemoorganotrophic Fueling Processes

## A Few Definitions

**Phosphorylation (phos)**
- The addition of a PO_3 group to a molecule, vital for the cellular storage and transfer of free energy using electron carrier molecules (ATP)
- The conversion of ADP to ATP can occur through two kings of phosphorylation

**Oxidative phosphorylation (ox-phos)**
- Energy released during the oxidation of nutrients is used to drive phosphorylation reactions (= oxidation and phosphorylation are coupled)
- Energy is captured as electrons and transferred from electron donors to electron acceptors, such as oxygen, in a series of redox reactions through an electron transport chain
- This energy is used to generate PMF and power an ATP-synthesizing enzyme (ATP synthase)
- Also occurs during anaerobic respiration = the oxidation of organic or inorganic substrate for ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation using terminal e acceptors other than oxygen

**Substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP)**
- Does not couple phosphorylation with oxidation
- The free energy required for phosphorylation is provided by the chemical energy released when a higher energy substrate is converted into a lower energy product
- Occurs in the cytoplasm of cells (glycolysis) and during the Krebs (TCA) cycle
- Can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions

## Chemoorganotrophic Fueling Processes

- Use reduced organic compounds for catabolic and anabolic processes
- Also called chemoheterotrophs
- Processes used to catabolize energy source
	- Respiration
	- Fermentation

## Respiration

- Most respiration involved use of an electron transport chain
- Aerobic respiration - final electron acceptor is oxygen
- Anaerobic respiration - final electron acceptor is different oxidized molecule
- As electrons pass through the electron transport chain to the terminal electron acceptor, a proton motive force (PMF) is generated and used to synthesize ATP

## Chemoorganotrophic Fueling Processes

- Chemoorganotrophs, also called chemoheterotrophs, use reduced organic compounds for catabolic and anabolic processes using 2 major strategies
	1. Respiration
	2. Fermentation

- When organic compounds are oxidized, released electrons are accepted by e-carriers like FAD or NAD+
- Reduced electron carries (NADH or FADH) donate e's to an ECT -> respiration
	- In respiration reduced molecules are oxidized with O2 (aerobic respiration) or, in the absence of oxygen, using a different oxidized molecules like nitrate of sulfate (anaerobic respiration) as the TEA to generate e's for an ETC
	- The transport of e's through an ETC generate PMF
	- PMF is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi (ox phos); a small amount is made by SLP
	- NADH and FADH are reoxidized, can again accept and donate (to ETC) e's

- Fermentation does not use an ATC or an external TEA, uses an endogenous (from within the cells) TEA (usually an intermediate like pyruvate)
	- NADH is oxidized so that is can be reused
	- ATP is synthesized almost exclusively by SLP

### Respiration

- Electrons are donated to ETC
- PMF
- ATP synthesis by mostly by ox phos (oxidative phosphorylation)
- A small amount of ATP made by SLP (substrate level phosphorylation)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250610134423.png)

### Fermentation

- Uses an endogenous electron acceptor
- Electron acceptor is an intermediate of the pathway used to oxidize the organic energy source (pyruvate)
- Does not involved the use of an electron transport chain
- ATP synthesized only by SLP

![](Pasted%20image%2020250610134619.png)

## Fueling Reactions and Energy Sources

- Despite diversity of energy, electron, and carbon sources used by organisms, they all have the same basic needs
	- ATP as energy currency
	- Reducing power
	- Precursor metabolites for biosynthesis

![](Pasted%20image%2020250610134715.png)


## Energy Sources
- Wide variety of organic molecules used an energy sources
- Degradation pathways generate glucose of intermediates of the pathways used in glucose metabolism
- Ohly a few pathways
- Each breaks down many nutrients to increase metabolic efficiency


# 11.3 - Aerobic Respiration Starts with Glucose Oxidation


## Glucose Metabolism

- Respiration catabolized reduced organic energy source (such as glucose) to CO2 using glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle

Glucose catabolism (3 Steps)
1) Formation of pyruvate
2) Pyruvate is fed to TCA and oxidized to CO2, producing GTP, NADH, and FADH
3) NADH, and FADH are oxidized by ETC, using O2 as the terminal electron acceptor (aerobic)
4) Produces ATP (most of it indirectly via the activity of the electrons transport chian) and high energy electron carriers

## Glycolytic Pathways

- Pathways to catabolize glucose to pyruvate in the cytosol
- In addition to ATP, pathways also provide materials for biosynthesis
- Microorganisms use several pathways to breakdown glucose, including
	- Embden-Meyerhof pathway (EMP) - most common
	- Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP)
	- Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP, also called the hexose monophosphate pathway)

## The Embden - Meyerhof Pathway

- Occurs in cytoplasmic matrix of most microorganisms, plants, and animals
- Functions in aerobic or anaerobic respiration or in fermentation
- The most common pathway for glucose degradation to pyruvate


- Generates several precursor metabolites
- Amphibolic pathway
	- EMP can run in reverse to convert 2 pyruvate molecules into a glucose molecules
- Six carbon phase
	- Cell invests some ATP so that it can make more
- Three-carbon phase
	- Energy conserving phase, NADH and ATP are produced
- ATP made by substrate-level phsophorylation

- When used in respiration
	- e's accepted by NAD+ are transferred to an ETC and are ultimately accepted by an exogenous TEA
- When used in fermentation
	- e's accepted by NAD+ are donated to an endogenous TEA

## The Entner-Doudoroff Pathway

- Glucose + ATP + NADP+ -> pyruvate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + ADP + NADPH + H+
- Replaces the 6-carbon phase of the Embder Meyerhof pathway
- Net yield per glucose molecules
	- 1 ATP
	- 1 NADPH
	- 1 NADH

## Details of Pentose Phosphate Pathway

- Also called hexose monophosphate pathway
- Can operate at same time as glycolytic pathway of Entner-Doudoroff pathway
- Can operate aerobically or anaerobically
- An amphibolic pathway


## Amphibolic Denfition
- Amphibolic describes a metabolic pathway that functions in both catabolisms (breaking down molecules) and anabolism (building molecules)

## Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex

- 1 glucose -> 2 pyruvate -> 3CO
- In the glycolytic pathways, glucose is oxidized to pyruvate
- Pyruvate is then oxized to 3CO
- Multienzyme complex that oxidizes and cleaves pyruvate to form on NADH, 1 CO_2, and acetyl coenzyme A
- Acetyl-CoA is an energy rich molecules because the bond that links acetic acid to coenzyme A has a large negative change in free energy when hydrolyzed

## The Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

- Also called citric acid cycle and Krebs cycle
- Cycle must turn twice to completely oxidize one molecule of glucose
- Common in aerobic bacteria, archaea, free-living protists, and fungi
- Major role is a source of precursor metabolites used in biosynthesis

## Summary TCA Cycle

- For each acetyl-CoA molecule oxidized, TCA cycle generates
- 2 molecules of CO_2
- 3 molecules of NADH
- 1 FADH_2
- 1 GTP

# 11.4 - Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation Generate the Most ATP
## Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation

- Only 4 ATP molecules synthesized directly from oxidation of glucose to CO_2
- Most ATP made when NADH and FADH_2 (formed as glucose degraded) are oxidized in electron transport chain (ETC)

## Electron Transport Chains

- The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) = a series of e- carries, operating together to transfer e- from NADH and FADH_2 to a terminal e- acceptor, O_2
- Electrons flow from carriers with more negative reduction potential (E_0) to carries with most positive E_0

## Electron Transport Chain - Redox Pairs

- Each carrier is reduced and then reoxidized
- The different in reduction potential between electron carries, NADH and O_2 is large, resulting in release of a great deal of energy

## Electron Transport Chain Molecules

- 2 kinds of electron carrier proteins
	- Flavin (Flavin monomucleotide)
		- Redox active
		- Flavin is the part of the molecule reduced when electron is accepted and then oxidized when that electron is donated
	- Quinones (coenzyme Q)
		- No prosthetic group
		- Can directly be reduced and oxidized

## Bacterial and Archaeal ETC's Unique

- Flexible - electron carriers can be replaced or different terminal oxidases may be used
- Located in plasma membrane
- Branched - electrons may enter the chain at several points and leave through several terminal oxidases
- Shorter - fewer proteins transported across the membrane and therefore less energy

## Summary

- The mitochondrial ETC - a series of e- carriers, operating together to transfer e- from NADH and FADH_2 to a TEA O_2
- e- flow from carriers with more negative reduction potentials (E_0) to carriers with more positive E_0
- Each carriers is reduced and then reoxidized
- The difference in reduction potentials between NADH and O_2 is large, resulting in release of a great deal of energy
## _Paracoccus denitrificans_

- Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe, soil bacterium
- Extremely versatile metabolically
- Under oxic conditions, uses aerobic respiration
- Similar electron carries and transport mechanisms as mitochondria
- Protons transported to perimlasmic space
- Can use one-carbon molecule (that is methanol) instead of glucose as a source of energy and electrons
## _Escherichia coli_

- Two branches
	- Oxygen available
		- Cytochrome _bo_ used
	- Oxygen limited
		- Cytochrome _bd_ used
		- Higher affinity for oxygen
		- Less efficient and moves fewer proteins into the periplasmic space


## Chemiosmotic Hypothesis

**Oxidative phosphorylation** - process by which ATP is synthesized using energy from electron transport, which in turn is driven by the oxidation of a chemical energy source and is best explained by the chemiosmotic hypothesis

- Protons move outward from the mitochondrial matrix (or plasma membrane from cytoplasm to periplasmic space in bacteria) as electrons move down the ETC
- Formation of a proton concentration gradient and charge gradient (chemical and electrical potential energy)
- Combined chemical and electrical potential different
- Proton motive force (PMF), needed for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase (inner surface of the plasma membrane in bacterial cells)
- PMF performs work when protons flow back across the membrane down the concentration and charge gradient into the cytoplasm and this is exergonic, phosphorylation of ADP, to ATP
- Movement of protons is not clearly understood, in some bacteria protons are actively "pumped" across the membrane

## The Central Role of Proton Motive Force

- PMF drive ATP synthesis and has other roles in the cell as well
- Diffusion of protons back across membrane (down gradient) drives formation of ATP
- ATP synthase (also called ATPases because they can hydrolyze ATP) uses PMF down gradient to catalyze ATP synthesis
	- Functions like rotary engine (conformational changes)
	- ATP is synthesized from ADP and P_i (ATP synthase phosphorylates ADP)
- The proton expulsion during e- transport results in the formation of a concentration gradient of protons and a charge gradient
- The combined chemical and electrical potential difference make up the proton motive force (PMF)

## Protom Motive Force (PMF) Summary

- PMF performs work when protons flow back across the membrane, down the concentration gradient, and into the cytoplasm
- Exergonic flow of proton back across membrane drive formation of ATP and ADP

ATP synthase
- Uses PMF for ATP synthesis
- Functions like rotary engine (conformational changes)

## ATP Yield During Aerobic Respiration

- Maximum ATP yield can be calculated
	- Called phosphorus to oxygen (P/O) ratio
	- ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation
- The maximum total yield of ATP during aerobic respiration by eukaryotes is 32 ATP
- SLP
	- 2 ATP per glucose converted to pyruvate
	- 2 ATP generated during 2 turns of the TCA cycle needed to oxidize 2 acetyl-CoA molecules
- Up to
	- 10 NADH (2 from glycolysis, 2 from pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA, 6 from the TCA cycle)
	- 2 FADH (from the TCA cycle)
- Ge

## Theoretical vs. Actual Yield of ATP Summary

- Amount of ATP produced during aerobic respiration varies depending on growth conditions and nature of ETC
- Factors affecting ATP yield
	- Bacterial ETCs are shorted and have lower P/O ratios
	- ATP production may vary with environmental conditions
	- PMF in bacteria and archaea is used for other purposes than ATP production (flagella rotation)
	- Precursor metabolite may be used for biosynthesis
		- Cells regulate the flow of carbons from glucose to ensure there is adequate ATP production and biosynthesis

# 11.5 - Anaerobic Respiration Uses the Same Steps as Aerobic Respiration
## Anaerobic Respiration

- Can use both organic and inorganic molecules as electrons donors
- Terminal electron acceptor is something other than O_2
	- Nitrate, sulfate, ferric iron, manganic ion, selenate, arsenate, CO_2, metals and organic molecules can be terminal electron acceptors

- Dissimilatory nitrate reduction
	- Use of nitrate as terminal electron acceptor, making it unavailable to cell for assimilation or uptake
- Denitrification
	- Use of nitrate as an e acceptor and reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas
	- Organic compounds may also be used as electron acceptors in 

# 11.6 - Fermentation Does Not Involve an Electron Transport Chain
## Fermentation

- NADH produced by glycolysis must be oxidized back to NAD+, even through there is no ETC to accept electrons from NADH
- Pyruvate or derivative used as endogenous electron acceptor
- Oxygen not needed
- Oxidative phosphorylation does not occur
- ATP formed by substrate-level phosphorylation

- Lactic acid (lactate)
- Reduction pf pyruvate to lactate
- Homolactic fermenters
	- All pyruvate reduced to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase
	- Heterolactic fermenters
	- Forms other produced, in addition to lactate (EtOH and CO_2)
- Alcohol fermentation
	- Pyruvate decarboxylated to acetaldehyde, which is reduced to ethon
