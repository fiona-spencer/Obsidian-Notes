# 7.1 - Most Bacteria and Archaea Reproduced by Binary Fission

## Reproductive Strategies of Bacteria and Archaea

- Most bacterial and archaeal cells reproduce by binary fission
- Some bacteria reproduced by forming a bug or multiple fission
- All must replicate and segregate the genome prior to division

Stages

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526130058.png)

1) A cell at early phase of cycle
2) Prepares for division
	1) Enlarging its cell wall
	2) Plasma membrane, and volume
	3) DNA replication
3) Septum forms
	1) Chromosomes move to opposite end
	2) Other cytoplasmic components are distributed
4) Septum is synthesizes through the cell center
5) Daughter cells separate or remained attached
	1) Forming chains, doublets, or other arrangements


## Some Bacteria Reproduce by Methods Other Than Binary Fission

**Budding** - a vegetative outgrowth of yeast and some bacteria as a means of asexual reproduction
- The daughter cell is smaller then the parnet
- Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of a _Listeria monocytogenes_ cell
**Baeocytes** - small, spherical, reproductive cells produced by some cyanobacteria through multiple fission
**Spore Formation** - by _Streptomyces coelicolor_ illustration shows a spore, the germ tube, vegetative hypha, branch, aerial hypha, and formation of spores on the aerial hypha
- The micrograph shows branches filaments, aerial hyphae, and chains of spores

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526130349.png)





# 7.2 - Bacterial Cell Cycles Are Divided Into Three Phases

## Bacterial Cell Cycle

- The cell cycle is the complete sequences of event extending from formation of a new cell through the next cell division

3 Phases
1. Period of growth after the cell is born
	1. Cell enters growth where a single cell increases in size
2. Chromosome replication and partitioning
3. Cytokinesis, during which a septum and daughter cells are formed

## Chromosomes Replication and Partitioning

- Most bacterial have a single circular chromosome
- Single origin of replication, site at which replication begins
- Terminus, site at which replication is terminated, located opposite of the origin
- **Replisome** is the DNA synthesis machinery
- DNA replication processed in both directions from the origin
- Origin move to opposite ends of the cell, and the rest of each chromosome follows

## Cell Cycle of _E. coli_

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526130551.png)

1) Initiation of the cell cycle results from an increase in the mass of a cell,
	1) Accumulation of the DnaA protein, which initiates DNA replication
2) Origin of replication and the terminus migrate to the cell center
	1) Proteins needed for chromosomes replication assemble at the origin and form the replisome
	2) DNA replications starts at both direction from the origin
	3) Cell increases its length
3) Cell reaches a threshold length and initiation of septum formation (cytokinesis) starts

- Generation times of ~20 mins
- 2nd and 3rd rounds of DNA replication are initiated before division of the original cell is completed
- Daughter cells inherit partially replicated DNA

## Cytokinesis and Septation

**Cytokinesis** - formation of two daughter cells following cell division

**Septation** - formation of cross wall between two daughter cells
- Bacterial cells divide by targeting a transmembrane protein machine (divisome) to the division site and regulating its assembly and disassembly to that cytokinesis occurs at the correct time in the cell cycle
- The divisome also regulates peptidoglycan remodeling to divide the sacculus (peptidoglycan mesh)

## Cellular Growth and Determination of Cell Shape

- After the cell is born, it enters growth where a single cell increases in size
- Cell shape is strict and is passed on through generation
	- Some microbes change shape under certain circumstances

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526131200.png)


## Cell Shape Determination

- Cellular location of peptidoglycan synthesis plays role in determining cell shape
- Coccus
	- Peptidogylycan only forms at central septum
	- FtsZ localization placement
	- Acts as prokaryotic homologue of the eukaryotic protein tubulin

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526131350.png)


## Rod and Curved Cell Shape
Rod
- Elongasome (rod complex)
	- MreB is scaffold, by creating filaments along cytoplasmic face of plasma membrane
	- Growth occurs in numerous bands around cell, not at the poles
Curved
- Crescentin localizes to one side of the cell, resulting in asymmetric cell wall and vibroid shape

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526131420.png)

# 7.3 - Archaeal Cell Cycles Are Unique
## Archaeal Cell Cycles Resemble Eukaryal Cell Cycles - Except in Segregation of Chromosomes

- Acidophilic and thermophilic _Sulfolobus spp._ indicate a cycle similar to a mitotic cell cycle
	- Growth phase 1 (G1)
	- DNA replication (S)
	- Growth phase 2 (G2)
	- Segregation (SegA/SegB)

## Cytokinesis in _Sulfolobus spp._

**CdvA** - Bind the membrane and forms a non-contractile ring at mid-cell
**CdvB** - Ring constricts to separate the daughter cells
**CdvC** - Recruited with CdvB to the site of division
**FtsZ** - Z0ring associates with the S-layer

_*Cdv - cell division protein_

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526131539.png)



## Archaeal Cytokinesis Similar to Eukaryotes

- All archaea lack peptidoglycan
	- In bacteria Z-ring is physically associated with the peptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes
	- In archaea, Z-ring associates with the new S-layer proteins and cell wall components
- Archaeal Z-ring associated with the new S-layer proteins and possibly other cell wall components

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521190645.png)


# 7.4 - Growth Curves Consist of 5 Phases
## Growth

- Increases in cellular constituents that may result in
	- Increase in cell number
	- Increase in cell size
- Growth most commonly referred to as population growth rather than growth of individual cells

## Microbial Growth Curve

- Observed when microorganisms are cultivated in liquid (broth) culture

**Batch culture** - incubated in a closed vessel with a single batch of medium

- Usually plotted as logarithm of cell number versus time
- Has 5 distinct phases

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526131856.png)



## 1. Lag Phase

- Cell synthesizing new components
- Replenish spent materials (ribosomes and ATP)
- To adapt to new medium or other conditions
- Eventually, cells replicate their DNA, increase in mass, and divide
- Varies in length
	- Can be very short or absent
## 2. Exponential Phase

- Rate of growth and division is constant and maximal
- Population is most uniform in terms of chemical and physical properties during this phase
### Exponential Phase Growth Rate Depends on Nutrient Availability

- During exponential phase, cells grow as quickly as they can for the conditions available
	- Final new growth increases with the initial amount of the limiting nutrient present
	- Growth rate increases with nutrient concentration, but it will saturate transport mechanisms, and growth rate does not increase even with more nutrients

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526132050.png)

## 3. Phases of Growth - Stationary Phase

- In a closed system, growth eventually ceases
- Total number of variable cells remains constant
	- Heterogeneous population
		- Balance between cell division and cell death
	- Population may cease to divide but remain metabolically active

Reasons for stationary phase
- Nutrient limitation
- Limited oxygen availability
- Toxic wast accumulation
- Critical population density reaches

## 4. Death Phase

- Number of viable cells declines exponentially, with cells dying at a constant rate
- Nutrient deprivation and the buildup of toxic wastes causes irreparable harm to the cells

## 5. Long-Term Stationary Phase

- Bacterial population continually evolved
- Process marked by successive waves of genetically distinct variants
- Natural selection occurs within a single culture
## Mathematics of Growth

Generation (doubling) time
- Time required for the population to double in size
- Varies depending on species of microorganisms and environment
- Range from 10 minutes for some bacterial to days for some eukaryotes

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526132202.png)

## Generation Times


![](Pasted%20image%2020250526133437.png)


## Calculation of Growth Rate

**Growth rate constant (k)** - number of generation per unit time

$N_0$ - initial population number
$N_t$ - population at time $(t)$
$n$ - number of generations in time $(t)$

$N_t = N_0$ x $2^n$

## Calculation of Generation Time

- Solving for $n$, the number of generations, where all logarithms are to the base 10

$logN_t = logN_0 + n * log2$
$$k = \frac{n}{t} = \frac{logN_t - logN_0}{0.301t}$$

#### Practice Question 1

**G:**
$N_0$ = 1 cell in 50 ml
$N_t = 10^8$ x $50 ml$ = $5.0$ x $10^9$
$t$ = 24 hours


_What is the generation time of culture_?

$n= \frac{log(N_t) - log(0)}{log2} = \frac{log(N_t) - log(0)}{0.301}$

$= \frac{log(5.0E9) - log(1)}{0.301} = 32.2 generations in 24 hours$

$k = \frac{n}{t} = \frac{32.2 generations}{24 hours} = 1.34 generations/hour$

$g = \frac{1}{k} = \frac{1}{0.34} = 0.74 h/gen = ~45 mins/gen$


#### Practice Question 2

**G:**
$N_0 = 10^3$
$N_t = 10^8$ x $50 ml$ = $5.0$ x $10^9$
$g$ = 90 mins/gen
$t$ = 8 hours = 480 mins

$n = \frac{t}{g} = \frac{480 mins}{90 min/gen} = 5.33 gen$

$N_t = N_0$ x $2^n = 10^3(2^{5.33}) = 40320$ cells


## Generation Times

# 7.5 - Environmental Factors Affect Microbial Growth

## The Influence of Environmental Factors on Growth

- Most organisms grow in fairly moderate environmental conditions

**Extremophiles** - grow under harsh conditions that would kill most other organisms

- All microbes must respond to changes in their environment
- Microbes have an optimal range of an environmental parameter for best growth

## Solutes Affect Osmosis and Water Activity

- Changes in osmotic concentrations in the environment may affect microbial cells

Hypotonic solution
- Lower solute concentration outside the cell than inside the cell
	- Water enters the cell and may burst

Hypertonic solution
- Higher solute concentration outside the cell than inside the cell
	- Water leaves the cell and membrane shrink

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526133546.png)

## Microbes Adapt to Changes in Osmotic Concentrations

- Most microbes live in hypotonic environment
	- Protected by call wall, preventing over-expansion of plasma membrane
- Mechanisms to lower solute concentration in cytoplasm
	- Mechanosensitive (MS) channels in plasma membrane allows solute to leave
		- Protists use contractile vacuoles to expel excess water
- Increase internal solute concentration with compatible solutes to increase their interal osmotic concentration in hypertonic solution
	- Solutes compatible with metabolism and growth

## Osmophiles

- Grows best in high solute concentrations (bring and sugar)
	- Osmophilic yeasts cause food spoilage (fruit juice concentrates)

**Halopiles** - requires NACl or other salts at a concentration above amount 0.2 M
**Extreme halophiles** - require salt concentration between 3 M and 6.2 M
**Archaeal halophiles** - environements with salt concentration near saturation (Dead Sea, Great Salt Lake)

Adaptation Strategies
- Salt in (archaeal halophiles)
	- Accumulate K and Cl in cytoplasm
	- Proteins need these high salt levels
	- Plasma membranes and cell wall need high Na ion concentration to maintain stability
- Salt out
	- Keep salt ions outside of cell
	- Synthesize compatible solutes that do not interfere with grwoth


![](Pasted%20image%2020250526133710.png)

## Solutes and Water Activity

Water activity ($a_W$)
- Measure of the degree of water availability
- Low water activity means most water is bound, not available to microorganisms
- 1/100 the relative humidity of solution
- Equal to ration of solution's vapour pressure ($P_{soln}$) of that of pure water ($P_{water}$)


## pH: Potential of hydrogen

- pH is a measure of the relative acidity of a solution
	- Negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration
	- pH = -log\[$H^+$] = -log\[$\frac{1}{H^+}$] 

Acidophiles
- pH 0 and 5.5


Alkaliphiles (alkalophiles)
- pH 8 and 11.5


## pH Preference of Microorganisms

- Most bacteria and protists are neutrophiles
- Most fungi prefer more acidic surrounding, about pH 4 to 6
	- Photosynthetic protists also favour slight acidity
- Some archaea are acidophiles
- Alkaliphiles are distributed among all three domains of life

## pH Tolerance Mechanisms of Microbes

- Microorganisms respond to external pH changes using mechanisms that maintain a neutral cytoplasmic pH

**Neutrophiles** - 
**Extreme acidophiles** - 
**Alkaliphiles** - 

Response to pH changes:
- Pump $H^+$ out of the cell
- Multiple enzymes with different pH optima
- Some synthesize acid and heat shock proteins that protect proteins (prevent denaturation, support re-folding)


## Temperature

- Microbes cannot regulate their internal temperatures
- Enzymes have optimal temperature at which they function optimally
- Below optimum temperature, enzymes is not catalytic
- High temperatures may inhibit enzyme functions and be lethal

Cardinal Temperatures
- Minmum
- Maximum
- Optimal

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526135937.png)


### Cardinal Temperatures for Select Microorganisms

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526140102.png)

### Temperature Range for Microbial Growth

**Psychrophiles** - 0°C to 20°C
**Psychrotrophs** - 0°C to 20°C
**Mesophiles** - 0°C to 20°C
**Thermophiles** - 0°C to 20°C
**Hyperthermophiles** - 0°C to 20°C

Adaptation of Psychrophiles:
- Plasma membrane lipids
	- High levels of unsaturated fatty acids
	- Semi-fluid when cold
- Cytoplasm
	- Decrease freezing point of cytosol
	- Secretes anitfreeze proteins


### Adaptations of Thermophiles 

- Heat-stable enzymes and protein synthesis systems that function at high temperatures
- Protein structure stabilized by a variety of means
	- More H bonds
	- More proline, less flexible peptides
	- Chaperones aid in folding
- Membrane stabilized by variety of means
	- More saturated, more branched and higher molecular weight
	- Ether linkages, resistant to hydrolysis


### Oxygen Concentration

- Growth in presence of different oxygen concentrations depends on a microbe's metabolic processes
- Electrron transport chains (ETC), terminal electron acceptor used

5 Types of Relationships to $O_2$
1) Obligate aerobe - requires O_2
2) Obligate anaerobe - killed in the presence of O_2
3) Microaerophile - requires 2 to 10% O_2
4) Facultative anaerobe - does not require O_2, but grows better in its presence
5) aerotolerant anaerobe - grow with or without O_2

### Oxygen and Bacterial Growth

- Using $O_2$ causes oxidative stress (toxic derivatives-reactive oxygen species, ROS)
- Growth in different O_2 concentrations depends on a microbe's metabolic processes
	- ETC
	- Terminal electron acceptor used

SOD = superoxide dismutase catalyze the destruction of super oxide radicals
- Catalase and peroxidase detoxify hydrogen peroxide

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526141121.png)
### Basis of Different Oxygen Sensitivities

- Oxygen reduced to reactive oxygen species (ROS)
- ROS (can damage proteins, DNA and lipids)
	- Superoxide radical ($O_2^-$)
	- Hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$)
	- Hydroxyl radical ($OH$)
- Microorganisms must be able to protect itself from ROS
- Aerobes produce protective enzymes
	- SOD (superoxide dimutase) -> oxygen and hydrogen peroxide
	- Catalase (w/ hydrogen peroixde) -> water and oxygen
	- Peroxidase (w/ hydrogen peroxide) -> water, and NAD+
- Neutrophils and macrophages use ROS to kill pathogens

### Pressure

- Microbes that live on land and water surface live at a pressure of 1 atm
- Some _Bacteria_ and _Archaea_ live in deep sea with very high hydrostatic pressures

**Barotolerant** - adversely affected by increased pressure, but not as severely as non-tolerant organisms
**Peizophilic** - requires high pressure for growth

- Change membrane fatty acids to adapt to increasing pressure
- Lipids become more unsaturated and shorter


### Harmful Radiation

Ionizing Radiation
- X-rays and gamma rays
  Cause mutations that indirectly result in death
- Distrupt chemical structure of many molecules
	- Break H-bonds and destroys ring structures
- Bacterial endospores and _Deinococcus radiodurans_ are resistant to ionizing radition

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526141620.png)


### Radiation Damage - UV and Visible Light

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation
- Most lethal wavelength is 260 nm because it is absorbed by DNA
- DNA damage can be repairs by several repair mechanisms

Visible light
- At high intensities generates singlet oxygen ($^1O_2$), a powerful oxidizing agen
- Carotenoid pigments protect many light-exposed microorganisms from photo-oxidation

# 7.6 - Microbial Growth in Natural Environments
## Microbial Growth in Natural Environments

Microbial environments
- Complex and constantly changing
- Expose a microorganisms to overlapping gradients of nutrients and environmental factors
- Contain both micro- and macro- organisms

## Most Microbes Live in Growth-Arrested States

- Few microbes live in nutrient rich (eutrophic) environments
- Most microbes inhabit low nutrient (oligotrohpic) environments
- Microbes have evolved many responses to starvation and environmental stree
	- Morphological changes (endospore formation)
	- Growth arrest, enter stationary phase
	- Can use cellular components as nutrients
	- Numerous proteins that help
	- Viable, but not culturable state, resume growth once nutrients return
	- Persisters

## Biofilms are Common in Nature

- Most microbes grow attached to surfaces (sessile), rather than free floating (planktonic)
- Slime enclosed communities of microbes are called biofilms
	- Ubiquitous in nature in water
	- Formed on any conditioned surface
	- Detrimental
		- Medial devices
		- Organism sloughing can contaminate water phase


## Biofilm Formation

- Microbes reversibly attach to conditioned surface and release polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA to form the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)
- Additionally polymers are produced as microbes reproduce and biofilm matures

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526142104.png)

1) Substratum pre-conditioning by ambient molecules
2) Cell deposition
3) Cell absorption
4) Desorption
5) Cell-to-cell signalling and onset of exopolymer production
6) Connective and diffuse transport of O_2 and nutrients
7) Replication and growth
8) Secretion of polysaccharide
9) Detachment, erosion, and sloughing


## Heterogeneity in Biofilms

- A mature biofilm is a complex, dynamic community of microorganisms
- Heterogeneity is differences in metabolic activity and locations of microbes
- Interactions occur among the attaches organisms
	- Use molecules to communicate and DNA uptake can occur in community

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526142426.png)

## Biofilm Microogranisms

Emergent properties
- Properties could not be predicted from studying single cell
- Phsiological changes and EPS protect microbes from harmful agents (UV)
- When formed on medical devices, such as implants, antibiotic treatment fails
- Chunk of biofilm can be sloughed off which can contaminate a drinking water system

## Cell-Cell Communication Within Microbial Population

Quorum sensing
- Bacterial cells communicate via small molecules that diffuse in the environment
- Sufficient number of microbes must be present and participating

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526142623.png)


## Quorum Sensing Systems

N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)
- Autoinducer
- Moves across the plasma membrane from cytoplasm to the outside of the cell
- When cell population is high, AHL diffuses in the cell which induces specific gene expression
	- _Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses this to express virulence factors_
	- Bioluminescent bacteria use this to light
- Autoinducing peptides (AIPs)
	- Gram positive bacteria
	- Autoinducing short peptides

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526142832.png)


# 7.7 - Laboratory Culture of Microbes Requires Conditions that Mimic Their Normal Habitats

## Culture Media

**Culture medium** - solid or liquid mixture of nutrients of other compounds
- Need to grow, transport, and store microorganisms in lab

- Must contain all growth factors microorganisms requires
- Use knowledge about microbe's normal habitat when selecting culture media
- Classified based on chemical composition, physical nature and their function


## Types of Media

**Defined/synthetic medium** - each ingredient can be defined with a chemical formula

**Complex Media** - contain some ingredients of non-specific chemical composition

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526142950.png)


## Some Media Components

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526143019.png)

**Peptones** - partial preteotytic digestion of protein sources
**Extracts** - aqueous extracts that contain amino acids, peptides, nucleotides, organic acids, vitamins, and minerals
**Agar** - sulfated polymer solidifying agent
- Most microorganisms cannot degrade it

## Functional Types of Media

**Supportive media** - tryptic soy broth and agar
- Sustain growth of many microorganisms

**Enriched media** - Blood agar
- Supportive media supplemented with special nutrients

## Selective and Differential Media

**Selective media** - allow the growth of particular micro-organisms
- While inhibiting the growth of others
- Gram-negative bacteria can grow on bile salts, while Gram-positive bacteria cannot


**Differential media** - distinguish among different groups of microbes and even permit tentative identification of microbes based on their biological characteristics
- Blood agar
	- Hemolytic and non-hemolytic bacteria
- MacConkey
	- Lactose fermenters vs non-fermenters

## Cultivation of Anaerobic Microbes

- All strict anaerobic microorganisms lack or have very low quantities of superoxide dismutase and catalase
- Cannot tolerate O_2
- Grown in anaerobic chamber
- Hard transparent containers sealed tightly
- Candle jar

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526143747.png)


## Isolation of Pure Cultures

**Pure/axenic culture** - population of cells arising from a single cell

- Allows for the study of single type of microorganism in mixed culture
- To isolate a single bacteria, microbiologists enrich for the microbe of interest and then follow with methods to obtain a pure culture

## Enrichment Cultures

- Encourages growth of microbes with a particular characteristic, while inhibiting growth of others
- 3 factors
	- A suitable source of microbes
	- Nutrients that should and should not be included in the culture medium
	- Environmental conditions

## Steak Plate

- Technique of spreading a mixture of cells on a agar surface using an inoculating loop or swab
	- Goal is to obtain individual cells that are separated from each other
- Each cell can reproduce to form a separate colony (visible cluster of microorganisms)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526144129.png)

## Spread Plate

- Small volume of diluted mixture is transferred to the center of an agar plate and spread evenly over surface with a sterile bent rod
	- Dilution made by serial dilution


![](Pasted%20image%2020250526144201.png)
## Pour Plate

- Sample is serially diluted and mixed with liquid agar
- Mixture of cells and agar is poured into sterile culture dishes
- Useful when sampling a heterogenous population of microbes that might produce overgrown colonies

![](Pasted%20image%2020250526144300.png)


## New Approaches to Culturing Microbes

Culturomics
- Use miniature cultures and incubate in many different conditions to find the best one
- Bring natural environment into the lab (seawater)
- Diffusion chamber that slows nutrients to diffuse, but retains the microbes
- Dilution can contain a single cell
Co-culturing
- Growth on animals or tissues in lab

# 7.8 - Microbial Population Size Can Be Measured Directly or Indirectly
