# 7.1 - Most Bacteria and Archaea Reproduced by Binary Fission


## Reproductive Strategies of Bacteria and Archaea
## Re
## Binary Fission
## Some Bacteria Reproduce by Methods Other Than Binary Fission

# 7.2 - Bacterial Cell Cycles Are Divided Into Three Phases

## Bacterial Cell Cycle
## Chromosomes Replication and Partitioning

## Cell Cycle of _E. coli_
## Cytokinesis and Septation
## Cellular Growth and Determination of Cell Shape

## Cell Shape Determination
## Rod and Curved Cell Shape

# 7.3 - Archaeal Cell Cycles Are Unique
## Archaeal Cell Cycles Resemble Eukaryal Cell Cycles - Except in Segregation of Chromosomes

## Cytokinesis in _Sulfolobus spp._
## Archaeal Cytokinesis Similar to Eukaryotes

# 7.4 - Growth Curves Consist of 5 Phases
## Growth

## Microbial Growth Curve

## Lag Phase
## Exponential Phase
## Exponential Phase Growth Rate Depends on Nutrient Availability

## Phases of Growth - Stationary Phase

## Phases of Growth
## Mathematics of Growth

## Calculation of Growth Rate

## Calculation of Generation Time
