# 7.1 - Most Bacteria and Archaea Reproduced by Binary Fission

## Reproductive Strategies of Bacteria and Archaea

- Most bacterial and archaeal cells reproduce by binary fission
- Some bacteria reproduced by forming a bug or multiple fission
- All must replicate and segregate the genome prior to division

## Some Bacteria Reproduce by Methods Other Than Binary Fission

**Budding** - 



# 7.2 - Bacterial Cell Cycles Are Divided Into Three Phases

## Bacterial Cell Cycle
## Chromosomes Replication and Partitioning

## Cell Cycle of _E. coli_
## Cytokinesis and Septation
