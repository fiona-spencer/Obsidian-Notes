# 7.1 - Most Bacteria and Archaea Reproduced by Binary Fission

## Reproductive Strategies of Bacteria and Archaea

- Most bacterial and archaeal cells reproduce by binary fission
- Some bacteria reproduced by forming a bug or multiple fission
- All must replicate and segregate the genome prior to division

Stages
1) A cell at early phase of cycle
2) A cell prepares for division by enlarging its cell wall, plasma membrane, and overall volume
	1) DNA replication starts
3) The septum grows inwards as the chromosomes move toward opposite ends of the cell
	1) Other cytoplasmic components are distributed to the two daughter cell
4) The septum is synthesizes completely through the cell center, creating two separate cells


## Some Bacteria Reproduce by Methods Other Than Binary Fission

**Budding** - a vegetative outgrowth of yeast and some bacteria as a means of asexual reproduction
- The daughter cell is smaller then the parnet
- Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of a _Listeria monocytogenes_ cell
**Baeocytes** - small, spherical, reproductive cells produced by some cyanobacteria through multiple fission
**Spore Formation** - by _Streptomyces coelicolor_ illustration shows a spore, the germ tube, vegetative hypha, branch, aerial hypha, and formation of spores on the aerial hypha
- The micrograph shows branches filaments, aerial hyphae, and chains of spores

# 7.2 - Bacterial Cell Cycles Are Divided Into Three Phases

## Bacterial Cell Cycle

- The cell cycle is the complete sequences of event extending from formation of a new cell through the next cell division

3 Phases
1. Period of growth after the cell is born
	1. Cell enters growth where a single cell increases in size
2. Chromosome replication and partitioning
3. Cytokinesis, during which a septum and daughter cells are formed

## Chromosomes Replication and Partitioning

- Most bacterial have a single circular chromosome
- Single origin of replication, site at which replication begins
- Terminus, site at which replication is terminated, located opposite of the origin
- Replisome is the DNA synthesis machinery
- DNA replication processed in both directions from the origin
- Origin move to opposite ends of the cell, and the rest of each chromosome follows

## Cell Cycle of _E. coli_

1) After a period of growth, initiation of the cell cycle results from an increase in the mass of a cell, resulting in the accumulation of the DNA A protein, which initiates DNA replication
2) The origin of replication and the terminus migrate to the cell center, proteins that are needed for chromosome replication assemble at the origin and form the replisome, the DNA synthesizing machinery
3) The cell reaches a certain threshold length and initiation of septum formation (cytokinesis) is triggered, resulting in two daughter cells that have inherited one chromosome each
4) One rou

## Cytokinesis and Septation

**Cytokinesis** - formation of two daughter cells following cell division

**Septation** - formation of cross wall between two daughter cells
- Bacterial cells divide by targeting a transmembrane protein machine (divisome) to the division site and regulating its assembly and disassembly to that cytokinesis occurs at the correct time in the cell cycle
- The divisome also regulates peptidoglycan remodeling to divide the sacculus (peptidoglycan mesh)

## Cellular Growth and Determination of Cell Shape

- After the cell is born, it enters growth where a single cell increases in size
- Cell shape is strict and is passed on through generation
	- Some microbes change shape under certain circumstances

## Cell Shape Determination
## Rod and Curved Cell Shape
Rod
- Elongasome (rod complex)
	- MreB is scaffold, by creating filaments along cytoplasmic face of plasma membrane
	- Growth occurs in numerous bands around cell, not at the poles
Curved
- Crescentin localizes to one side of the cell, resulting in asymmetric cell wall and vibroid shape

# 7.3 - Archaeal Cell Cycles Are Unique
## Archaeal Cell Cycles Resemble Eukaryal Cell Cycles - Except in Segregation of Chromosomes

- Acidophilic and thermophilic _Sulfolobus spp._ indicate a cycle similar to a mitotic cell cycle
	- Growth phase 1 (G1)
	- DNA replication (S)
	- Growth phase 2 (G2)
	- Segregation (SegA/SegB)

## Cytokinesis in _Sulfolobus spp._

**CdvA** - Bind the membrane and forms a non-contractile ring at mid-cell
**CdvB** - Ring constricts to separate the daughter cells
**CdvC** - Recruited with CdvB to the site of division
**FtsZ** - Z0ring associates with the S-layer

_*Cdv - cell division protein_

## Archaeal Cytokinesis Similar to Eukaryotes

- All archaea lack peptidoglycan
- Archaeal Z-ring associated with the new S-layer proteins and possibly other cell wall components

# 7.4 - Growth Curves Consist of 5 Phases
## Growth

- Increases in cellular constituents that may result in
	- Increase in cell number
	- Increase in cell size
- Growth most commonly referred to as population growth rather than growth of individual cells

## Microbial Growth Curve

- Observed when microorganisms are cultivated in liquid (broth) culture

**Batch culture** - incubated in a closed vessel with a single batch of medium

- Usually plotted as logarithm of cell number versus time
- Has 5 distinct phases

## 1. Lag Phase

- Cell synthesizing new components
- Replenish spent materials (ribosomes and ATP)
- To adapt to new medium or other conditions
- Eventually, cells replicate their DNA, increase in mass, and divide
- Varies in length
	- Can be very short or absent
## 2. Exponential Phase

- Rate of growth and division is constant and maximal
- Population is most uniform in terms of chemical and physical properties during this phase
### Exponential Phase Growth Rate Depends on Nutrient Availability

- During exponential phase, cells grow as quickly as they can for the conditions available
	- Final new growth increases with the initial amount of the limiting nutrient present
	- Growth rate increases with nutrient concentration, but it will saturate transport mechanisms, and growth rate does not increase even with more nutrients

## 3. Phases of Growth - Stationary Phase

- In a closed system, growth eventually ceases
- Total number of variable cells remains constant
	- Heterogeneous population
		- Balance between cell division and cell death
	- Population may cease to divide but remain metabolically active

Reasons for stationary phase
- Nutrient limitation
- Limited oxygen availability
- Toxic wast accumulation
- Critical population density reaches

## 4. Death Phase

- Number of viable cells declines exponentially, with cells dying at a constant rate
- Nutrient deprivation and the buildup of toxic wastes causes irreparable harm to the cells

## 5. Long-Term Stationary Phase

- Bacterial population continually evolved
- Process marked by successive waves of genetically distinct variants
- Natural selection occurs within a single culture
## Mathematics of Growth

Generation (doubling) time
- Time required for the population to double in size
- Varies depending on species of microorganisms and environment
- Range from 10 minutes for some bacterial to days for some eukaryotes

## Calculation of Growth Rate

**Growth rate constant (k)** - number of generation per unit time

$N_0$ - initial population number
$N_t$ - population at time $(t)$
$n$ - number of generations in time $(t)$

$N_t = N_0$ x $2^n$

## Calculation of Generation Time

- Solving for $n$, the number of generations, where all logarithms are to the base 10

$logN_t = logN_0 + n * log2$
$$k = \frac{n}{t} = \frac{logN_t - logN_0}{0.301t}$$

#### Practice Question 1

**G:**
$N_0$ = 1 cell in 50 ml
$N_t = 10^8$ x $50 ml$ = $5.0$ x $10^9$
$t$ = 24 hours


_What is the generation time of culture_?

$n= \frac{log(N_t) - log(0)}{log2} = \frac{log(N_t) - log(0)}{0.301}$

$= \frac{log(5.0E9) - log(1)}{0.301} = 32.2 generations in 24 hours$

$k = \frac{n}{t} = \frac{32.2 generations}{24 hours} = 1.34 generations/hour$

$g = \frac{1}{k} = \frac{1}{0.34} = 0.74 h/gen = ~45 mins/gen$


#### Practice Question 2

**G:**
$N_0 = 10^3$
$N_t = 10^8$ x $50 ml$ = $5.0$ x $10^9$
$g$ = 90 mins/gen
$t$ = 8 hours = 480 mins

$n = \frac{t}{g} = \frac{480 mins}{90 min/gen} = 5.33 gen$

$N_t = N_0$ x $2^n = 10^3(2^{5.33}) = 40320$ cells
