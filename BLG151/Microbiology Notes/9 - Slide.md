# 10.1 - Metabolism - Important Principles and Concepts

## Microbial Metabolism

- Metabolism is the total of all chemical reactions in the cell and is divided into 2 parts
1) Catabolism
	1) Fuelling reactions
	2) Energy-conserving reactions
	3) Provide ready source of reducing power (electrons)
	4) Generate precursors for biosynthesis
2) Anabolism
	1) The synthesis of complex organic molecules from simpler ones
	2) Requires energy from fuelling reaction

## Aseptics of Metabolism Common to All Organisms

- Life obeys the laws of thermodynamics
- The energy cells obtain from their environment is most often conserved as. ATP
- Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions plays a critical role in energy conservation
- The chemical reactions that occur in cells are organized into pathways
- Each reaction of a pathway is catalyzed by an enzyme or a ribozyme
- The functioning of biochemical pathways is regulated

## Cellular Work and Energy Transfer

3 Major types of work
1. Chemical work - synthesis of complex molecules
2. Transport work - take up of nutrients, eliminate wastes, and maintain ion balances
3. Mechanical work - cell motility and movement of structures within cells

- Cell need energy to do work
- Harness energy from sunlight or chemicals
- Most commonly stored in ATP

## Laws of Thermodynamics

**Thermodynamics** - a science that analyzes energy changes in a collection of matter called a system

**First Law of Thermodynamics** - energy can be neither created nor destroyed
- Total energy in universe remains constant although can be converted

**Second Law of Thermodynamics** - Physical and chemical process proceed in such a way that the disorder of the universe increases

**Entropy** - amount of disorder in a system

## Energy Units

- Defines the amount of energy used in or evolving from a particular process

Calorie (cal)
- Amount of heat energy needed to raise 1 gram of water 1C, specifically from 14.5 to 15.5C

Joules (J)
- Units of work capable of being done
- 1 cal of heat is equivalent to 4.1840 J of work

## Free Energy and Reactions

$\Delta G =$ $\Delta H - T \Delta S$

- Relates the change in energy that can occur in chemical reactions and other processes
- Used to indicate if an reaction will proceed spontaneously
	- If $\Delta G$ in negative, reaction is spontaneous
	- If $\Delta G$ in positive, reaction is not spontaneous

$\Delta G$
- Change in free energy
- Amount of energy available to do work

$\Delta H$
- Change in enthalpy (heat content)

T
- Temperature in Kelvin (C + 273)

$\Delta S$
- Change in entropy (a measure of disorder, or of the unavailable energy in a closed thermodynamic system in a system)


## Chemical Equilibrium

Equilibrium
- The rate in both directions are equal and no further net change occurs in the concentration reactants and products
- Consider the chemical reaction

A + B = C + D

Equilibrium constant ($K_{eq}$)
- Relates the equilibrium concentrations of products and reactants to one another

## Standard Free Energy Change ($\Delta G \degree$)

- Free energy change is defined at standard conditions of concentration, pressure, pH, and temperature
- Maximum amount of energy available from the system for useful work under standard conditions

$\Delta G \degree '$
- Symbol indicating standard free energy change at pH 7

## The Relationship of $\Delta G \degree$ to the Equilibrium of Reactions



# 10.2 - ATP: The Major Energy Currency of Cells 



## Adenosine Triphosphate

- ATP is formed from energy made available during aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, fermentation, chemolithotrophy, and phototrophy
- 

## Role of ATP in Metabolism
## Phosphate Transfer Potential of Common Phosphorylated Compounds
## Formation of ATP

**Substrate level phosphorylation** - mechanisms for making ATP using molecules such as phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a source of the phosphoryl group


# 10.3 - Redox Reaction: Reactions of Central Importance in Metabolism
## Oxidation-Reaction (Redox) Reactions

- Many metabolism processes involve oxidation-reduction reaction
- Reaction involving the transfer of electrons from an electron donor to an electron acceptor
- Donor stores less energy and the acceptor stores more energy
	- Can result in energy release, which can be conserved and used to form ATP
	- The more electrons a molecules has, the more energy rich it is
	- Glucose, which can donate up to 24 electrons in redox reactions, is an excellent source of energy

## Redox: Two Half Reactions

- One is electron donating (oxidation reaction)
- One is electron-accepting reaction (reduction reaction)
- Acceptor and donor are conjugate redox pair
- Left side of reaction is a molecule that accept electrons and the number (n) is accepts, while the right side is the molecule it becomes after accepting the electrons

## Standard Redox Potential ($E_0$)

- Equilibrium constant for an oxidation-reduction reaction
- A measure of the tendency of the donor agent to lose electron
	- More negative $E_0$ -> better electron donor
		- Spontaneously donates electron
	- More positive $E_0$ -> better electron acceptor
		- Greater affinity for electrons

## Redox: Two Half Reactions

- Many

## (Standard) Redox Potential: $E$ or $E'_0$ (at pH7)

**Reduction potential ($E'_0$)** - the tendency of a substance to become oxidized or to become reduced
- A substance with greater tendency to donated electrons in the reduced form has a more negative $E'_0$
- A substance with a weak tendency to donate electrons in the reduced form has a less negative or even positive $E'_0$


- Most molecules can be either e-donors or e-acceptors
- 

## Electron Movement and Reduction Potentials

- The greater the difference between the $E_0$ of the donor and the $E_0$ of the acceptor, the more negative the $\Delta G\degree'$
- Electrons tend to move from donors at the top of the list to acceptors at the bottom
- The catabolism, the electron donor is often referred to as an energy source
- Many potential electrons donors exist in nature
- It is the chemical reaction in which the electron donor gets oxidized, that actually releases energy
- $O_2$ is the most favourable electron acceptor used by organisms

# 10.4 - Electron Transport Chains: Sets of Sequential Redox Reactions
## Electron Transport Chain (ETC)

- Electron carriers are membrane bound and organized into a system called the electron transport system (ETC)
- First electron carrier having the most negative $E'\degree$
- The potential energy stores in first redox couple is released and use to form ATP
- First carrier is reduced and electrons moved to the next carrier and so on

- Electrons transport chains are associated with membranes
- Electrons flow from the electron carrier with the most negative reduction potential to the carrier with the most positive reduction potential
- During respiratory process (aerobic respiration), the source of electrons is reduced molecules such as glucose and an exogenous molecule such as oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor

## Electron Carriers

- Located in plasma membranes and intracytoplasmic membranes of bacterial and archaeal cells
- Localized in the internal membrane of mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells
- Example of electron carriers include NAD, NADP, and others

## Structure and Function of NAD

- Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
- Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)
- Ring accepts 2 electrons an d 1 proton from a donor

## Additional Electron Carriers

Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)

- Flavin mononucleotide (FMN)
- Riboflavin phosphate

Coenzyme Q (CoQ)

- A quinone
- Also called ubiquinone

## Even More Electron Carriers

Cytochromes
- Use iron atoms to transfer electrons (ion is part of a heme group)

Nonheme iron proteins
- Use iron atoms to transport electrons (iron is associated with sulfur atoms)

- Ferredoxin

# 10.5 - Biochemical Pathways: Sets of Linked Chemical Reactions
## Biochemical Pathway Forms

- Pathways vary in forms
	- Linear
		- Starting molecule and end product defined
	- Cyclic
		- All molecules are considered intermediates
	- Branching
		- Can yield more than than product

## Biochemical Pathways Form Complex Networks

- Pathways often overlap/fee into each other
- Intermediates of a pathway may be diverted from one pathway to another pathway

**Metabolite flux** - rate of turnover of a metabolite
- Monitor changes in activity help to understand metabolic networks


# 10.6 - Enzymes and Ribozymes Speed Up Cellular Chemica Reactions
## Enzyme Terminology

**Enzyme** - protein catalysts that have great specificity for the reaction catalyzed, the molecules acted on, and the produces they yield

**Catalyst** - substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being permanently altered itself
- High specificity for the reaction catalyzed and the molecules acted on
- Some enzymes are composed solely of one or more proteins, others are composed of two parts; one protein component and a non-protein components


**Substrates** - reacting molecules

**Products** - substances formed by reaction

- Enzymes composition possibilities
- Only proteins
- Two parts, one protein components and a non-protein component


## Structure of Enzymes


**Apoenzyme** - protein component of an enzyme

**Cofactor** - non-protein component of an enzyme

**Prosthetic group** - covalently attached

**Coenzyme** - loosely attached and can dissociated

**Holoenzyme** - apoenzyme and cofactor

## Classification of Enzymes

- Six general class of enzymes
- Named based on the substrate they act on and the reaction they catalyze

## The Mechanism of Enzyme Reactions


- Enzymes increases the rates of reaction but do not alter their equilibrium constants
- A typical exergonic reaction


A + B -> AB -> C + D

- Transition-state complex resembles both the substrates and the products

**Activation energy** - energy required to form transition-state complex

## How Enzymes Lower ($E_a$)

- Enzyme speeds up reaction by lowering $E_a$
- Enzymes bring substrate together in the active site or catalytic site
- Induced fit model for enzyme-substrate interaction
- Substrates oriented properly to form the transition-state complex

1) Substrates ATP and glucose bind to the active site of enzyme (hexokinase)
2) Enzyme undergoes conformational change that strains the substrates and brings them close together (induced fit)
3) Substrates are converted to products
4) Products ADP and glucose 6-phosphate are released

## Environmental Effects on Enzyme Activity

- Enzyme activity is significantly impacted by
	- Substrate concentration
	- pH
	- Temperature

## Substrate Concentration Affects Enzyme Activity


- Reaction rate increases as substrate concentration increases
- No further increase occurs after all enzymes molecules are saturated with substrate

## Effect of pH and Temperature

- Each enzyme has specific pH and temperature optima
- Deviation from optimum will slow enzyme activity

Denaturation
- Loss of enzyme's structure and activity when temperature rises too much above optimum

## Enzyme Inhibition

Competition inhibitor
- Directly competes with binding of substrate to catalytic site and prevents the enzymes from forming product

Non-competitive inhibitor
- Bonds enzymes at site other than active site
- Change enzymes's shape so that it becomes inactive or less active

## Ribozymes


- Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman discovered that some RNA molecules also can catalyze reaction
	- Catalyze peptide bond formation
	- Self-splicing
	- Involved in self-replication
