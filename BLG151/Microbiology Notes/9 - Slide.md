# 10.1 - Metabolism - Important Principles and Concepts

## Microbial Metabolism

- Metabolism is the total of all chemical reactions in the cell and is divided into 2 parts
1) Catabolism
	1) Fuelling reactions
	2) Energy-conserving reactions
	3) Provide ready source of reducing power (electrons)
	4) Generate precursors for biosynthesis
2) Anabolism
	1) The synthesis of complex organic molecules from simpler ones
	2) Requires energy from fuelling reaction

## Aseptics of Metabolism Common to All Organisms

- Life obeys the laws of thermodynamics
- The energy cells obtain from their environment is most often conserved as. ATP
- Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions plays a critical role in energy conservation
- The chemical reactions that occur in cells are organized into pathways
- Each reaction of a pathway is catalyzed by an enzyme or a ribozyme
- The functioning of biochemical pathways is regulated

## Cellular Work and Energy Transfer

3 Major types of work
1. Chemical work - synthesis of complex molecules
2. Transport work - take up of nutrients, eliminate wastes, and maintain ion balances
3. Mechanical work - cell motility and movement of structures within cells

- Cell need energy to do work
- Harness energy from sunlight or chemicals
- Most commonly stored in ATP

## Laws of Thermodynamics

**Thermodynamics** - a science that analyzes energy changes in a collection of matter called a system

**First Law of Thermodynamics** - energy can be neither created nor destroyed
- Total energy in universe remains constant although can be converted

**Second Law of Thermodynamics** - Physical and chemical process proceed in such a way that the disorder of the universe increases

**Entropy** - amount of disorder in a system

## Energy Units

- Defines the amount of energy used in or evolving from a particular process

Calorie (cal)
- Amount of heat energy needed to raise 1 gram of water 1C, specifically from 14.5 to 15.5C

Joules (J)
- Units of work capable of being done
- 1 cal of heat is equivalent to 4.1840 J of work

## Free Energy and Reactions

$\Delta$ $\Delta H - T |Delta S$


## Chemical Equilibrium
## Standard Free Energy Change ($\Delta G \degree$)
## The Relationship of $\Delta G \degree$ to the Equilibrium of Reactions
