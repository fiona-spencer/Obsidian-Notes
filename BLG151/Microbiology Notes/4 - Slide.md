# 3.3 - Bacterial Plasma Membranes Control What Enters and Leaves the Cell


## Nutrients

**Macronutrients** - required in large amounts
- Found in organic molecules
	- Proteins
	- Lipids
	- Nucleic acids
	- Carbohydrates
- Cations contribute to the activity and stability of molecules and cell structures
	- Important on cellular processes (protein synthesis)

**Micronutrients** - required in small amounts
- Ubiquitous in nature and usually present in adequate amounts to support microbial growth
- Work to assist enzyme catalysis and maintain protein structure

## Growth Factors

- Organic compounds required for survival
- Essential cell components that the cell cannot synthesize and must be supplied by environment

## Methods for Uptake of Nutrients

- Microbes can only take in dissolved particles across a selectively permeable membrane
- Microorganisms use transport mechanisms
	- Passive diffusion
	- Facilitated diffusion
	- Primary and secondary active transport
	- Group translocation

## Passive Diffusion
- Molecules move from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration
- Requires a large concentration gradient for adequate nutrient uptake
- The rate of diffusion decreases as more nutrients accumulate in the cell
- H2o, 02, and CO2 easily cross the plasma membrane via passive diffusion


## Facilitated Diffusion

- Movement across the plasma membrane with the help of transport proteins
	- Channels
		- Proteins that form pores for substances to pass through
	- Carries
		- Proteins that have high substrate specificity in transport
- Truly diffusion because it is not energy dependent
	- Direction of movement is from high to low concentration
	- Size of concentration gradient impacts rate of uptake
	- Rate increases with the concentration gradient
		- If the gradient is lost, transport stops

## Facilitated vs. Passive Diffusion

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521152745.png)


## Active Transport

- Transport of molecules against the concentration gradient
- Energy-dependent process
- ATP or protin motive force used
- Involved carrier proteins that control the rate of transport
- When the solute concentration is high, carrier saturation effect is observed

## Primary Active Transport

- Use energy from ATP hydrolysis to move substances against concentration gradient without modifying them

**Uniporters** - single molecules transported across membrane
**ATP-binding cassette (ABC) tranporters**
- Made of
	- 2 hydrophobic membrane spanning domains
	- 2 cytoplasmic associated ATP-binding domains

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521154807.png)
## Secondary Active Transport

- Use potential energy of ion gradients to co-transport substances without modifying them
- Move both the ion and the substance across the membrane
	- Symport
		- 2 substances both move in the same direction
	- Antiport
		- 2 substances move in opposite directions

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521155000.png)

## Group Translocation
- Energy dependent transport that chemically modifies the molecules as it is brought into cell
- Best known translocation system is phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS)
- Imports sugars while phosphorlyating them

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521155051.png)

## Iron Uptake
- Microorganisms require iron for building molecules important in energy-conserving processes
	- Ferric ion is very insoluble so uptake is difficult

**Siderophores** - secreted by bacteria and complex with ferric ion for transport into cell

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521155132.png)
# 3.9 - Bacteria Move in Response to Environmental Conditions

## Motility
- Flagellar movement
	- Swimming
	- Swarming
	- Spirochete motility
- Twitching and gliding movement
- Chemotaxis
## Swimming

- Flagellum rotate like a propeller
	- Very rapid rotation tup to 1100 rev/sec
	- In general, counter-clockwise rotation causes forward motion
	- Clockwise rotation disrupts causing cell to stop and tumble

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521155214.png)


## Mechanisms of Flagellar Movement

- Flagellum is a 2 part motor producing torque
	1) Rotor - moving part
		- C (FliG protein) ring turn and interact with stator
	2) Stator - stationary parts
		- Form channel through plasma membrane
		- Protons move through Mot A and Mot B channels using energy of proton motive force
		- Torque powers rotation of the basal body and filaments
## Swarming
- Occurs on when cells move in unison across a moist surfaces
- Most swarmers habe peritrichous flagella
- Commonly, the cell produces a molecules that lowers surface tension
## Spirochete Motility

- Undulation of the entire cell
- Multiple flagella form axial fibril which winds around the cell
- Flagella remain inside the cell wall
- Corkscrew shape exhibits flexing and spinning movements

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521155428.png)


## Twitching and Gliding Motility
- Occurs on solid surface
- Does not involve flagella
- May involve Type IV pili and slime

Twitching motility
- Pili at ends of cells
- Short, intermittent, jerking motions
- Cells are in contact with each other and surface

Gliding
- Smooth movements that do not require appendages


## Chemotaxis
- Movement towards a chemical attractant or away from a chemical repellent
- Chemical attractants and repellents bind chemo-receptrors that transmit signals throughout the chemo-sensing system
- In presence of attractant/repellant, tumbling frequency is reduced
- Runs toward/away from compound are longer
- Behaviour of bacterium altered by temporal concentration of chemical

# 4.1 - Archaea Are Diverse but Share Some Common Features
## Archaea

# 4.2 - Archaeal Cell Envelopes are Structurally Diverse
## Archaeal Cell Envelopes

**Cell envelope** - plasma membrane and layers external to it

- Differ from bacterial cell envelopes in the molecular makeup and organization
- S-layer may be only component outside plasma membrane
- Some lack cell wall
- Slime layers are observed to mediate cell-cell interactions but little is known about composition and regulation
- Capsules and slime layers are rare but complex polysaccharides, proteins, or glycoproteins found in some other species
- No peptidoglycan, but some possess a peptidoglycan-like molecules called psuedomurein

## Archaeal Membranes

- Composed of unique lipids
- Hydrocarbons derived from isoprenes units
	- 5-carbon, branches molecules
	- Hydrocarbons attaches to glycerol by ether linkages, rather than ester linkages
- Some have a monolayer structure instead of a bilayer structure

## Archaeal Membrane Lipids
2 Major types
1. Glycerol diether lipid
	1. Hydrocarobns (20 carbons) attached to glycerol
	2. $C_{20}$ dithers make a bilayer
2. Diglyceral tetraether lipids
	1. 2 Hydrocarbonds (40 carbons) attaches to 2 glycerol
	2. Tetraethers are more rigid than diethers
	3. $C_{40}$ diethers make a monolayer

- Polar phospholipids, sulfolipids, glycolipids, and unique lipids are also found in archaeal membranes

## Comparison of Archaeal and Bacterial Lipids and Membranes

Bacteria/Eukaryotes
- Fatty acids attached to glycerol by ester linkages
- An ester linkage is a chemical bond formed between a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen atom that is part of an alkoxy group (R-O-)

Archaea
- Branched chain hydrocarbons (isoprenoids) attaches to glycerol by ester linkages
- An isoprene is a hydrocarbon consisting of five carbon atoms attached to eight hydrogen atoms $C_5H_8$

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521160823.png)

## Archaeal Cell Walls
- Lack peptidogylcan
- Most common cell wall is S-layer
- May have protein sheath external to S-layer
- S-layer may be outside membrane and separated by pseudomurein
	- Pseudomurien may be outermost layer, similar to Gram-positive micro-organisms
	- Pseuomurein differs from peptidoglycan in that is has
		- L-amino acids, instead of D-amino acids in its cross-links
		- _N-acetytalosaminuronic acids instead of N-acetylmuramic acid_
		- B(1->3) glycosidic bonds instead of B(1->4) glycosidic bonds

## Archaeal Cell Envelope Compositions

- Most common cell envelope in an S-layer composed of many copies of a single protein
- Some could have an extra protein or carbohydrate later above, below, or in place of the S-layer
- A few have a double membrane

1) Simple S-layer
2) S-layer + a carbohydrate layer
3) Carbohydrate layer below an S-layer
4) Carbohydrate (complex polysaccharide) instead of an S-layer
5) Double membrane without a cell wall

## Archaeal S-Layer Structure
- S-layer can be up to 70 nm thick
- Tethered to the plasma membrane
- Resembles a protein canopy from the side or a geometric pattern on the top
- S-layer proteins decorated with carbohydrates for stabilization

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521161057.png)

## Archaeal Extracellular Vesicles and Nanotubes
- Vesicles composed of the plasma membrane and the surrounding cell wall material, or simply the S-layer
- Cargo packed within includes cytoplasmic contents, proteins, and nucleic acids
- Thought to be important for intracellular gene transfer in thermophiles to protect DNA from denaturing in high temperatures

## Nucleoid
**Nucleoid** - region in the cytoplasm that contains the circular chromosomes and nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs)
- Irregularly shaped region in bacteria and archaea
- Usually not membrane bound
- Some evidence for polyploidy in archaea
- Supercoiling and nucleoid associated proteins
	- Aid in folding and chromosome condensation
