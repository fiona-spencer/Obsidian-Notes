# 3.3 - Bacterial Plasma Membranes Control What Enters and Leaves the Cell


## Nutrients

**Macronutrients** - required in large amounts
- Found in organic molecules
	- Proteins
	- Lipids
	- Nucleic acids
	- Carbohydrates
- Cations contribute to the activity and stability of molecules and cell structures
- Important on cellular processes

**Micronutrients** - required in small amounts
- Ubiquitous in nature and usually present in adequate amounts to support microbial growth
- Work to assist enzyme catalysis and maintain protein structure

## Growth Factors

- Organic compounds required for survival
- Essential cell components that the cell cannot synthesize and must be supplied by environment

## Methods for Uptake of Nutrients

- Microbes can only take in dissolved particles across a selectively permeable membrane
- Microorganisms use transport mechanisms
	- Passive diffusion
	- Facilitated diffusion
	- Primary and secondary active transport
	- Group translocation

## Passive Diffusion
- Molecules move from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration
- Requires a large concentration gradient for adequate nutrient uptake
- The rate of diffusion decreases as more nutrients accumulate in the cell
- H2o, 02, and CO2 easily cross the plasma membrane via passive diffusion


## Facilitated Diffusion

- Movement across the plasma membrane with the help of transport proteins
	- Channels
		- Proteins that form pores for substances to pass through
	- Carries
		- Proteins that have high substrate specificity in transport

## Facilitated vs. Passive Diffusion
## Active Transport

- Transport of molecules against the concentration gradient
- Energy-dependent process
- ATP or protin motive force used
- Involved carrier proteins that control the rate of transport
- When the solute concentration is high, carrier saturation effect is observed


## Primary Active Transport

- Use energy from ATP hydrolysis to move substances against concentration gradient without modifying them

**Uniporters** - single molecules transported across membrane
**ATP-binding cassette (ABC) tranporters**
- Made of
	- 2 hydrophobic membrane spanning domains
	- 2 cytoplasmic associated ATP-binding domains


## Secondary Active Transport

- Use potential energy of ion gradients to co-transport substances without modifying them


## Group Translocation
- Energy dependent transport that chemically modifies the molecules as it is brought into cell
- Best known translocation system



## Iron Uptake
- Microorganisms require iron for building molecules important in energy-conserving processes
	- Ferric ion is very insoluble so uptake is difficult

**Siderophores**


# 3.9 - Bacteria Move in Response to Environmental Conditions


## Motility
- Flagellar movement
	- Swimming
	- Swarming
	- Spirochete motility
- Twitching and gliding movement
- Chemotaxis
## Swimming

- Flagellum rotate like a propeller
	- Very rapid rotation tup to 1100 rev/sec
	- In general, counter-clockwise rotation causes forward motion
	- Clockwise rotation disrupts causing cell to stop and tumble
## Mechanisms of Flagellar Movement

- Flagellum is a 2 part motor producing torque
	1) Rotor - moving part
		- 
	2) Stator - stationary parts
		- 
## Swarming
- Occurs on when cells move in unison across a moist surfaces
## Spirochete Motility

- Undulation of the entire cell
- Multiple flagella form axial fibril which winds around the cell
- Flagella remain inside the cell wall
- Corkscrew shape exhibits flexing and spinning movements
## Twitching and Gliding Motility
- 


## Chemotaxis
- Movement towards a chemical attractant or away from a chemical repellent
- Chemical attractants and repellents bind chemo-receptros that transmit signals throughout the chemo-sensing system
- In presence of attractant/repellant, tumbling frequency is reduced



# 4.1 - Archaea Are Diverse but Share Some Common Features
## Archaea
- Archaea and bacteria were jointly referred to as prokaryotes
- 

## Comparison of Bacterial and Archaeal Cells
## Archaeal Shape, Arrangement, and Size

- Cocci and rods are common shapes
- Other shapes
	- No spirochete-like or mycelial forms discovered yet
	- Unique branched and flat shapes have been observed
- Sizes
	- Rods = 1 to 2 um x 1 to 5 um long
	- Cocci = 1 to 3 um in diameter
- Smallest observed is 0.2 um in diameter
- Largest is multicellular (30 mm)

## Archaeal Cell Morphology and Sizes

- The filament is composed of cells measuring 8 to 10 um wide by 20 to 24 um long
- Archaeon is the host and the bacteria are symbionts


# 4.2 - Archaeal Cell Envelopes are Structurally Diverse
## Archaeal Cell Envelopes

**Cell envelope** - plasma membrane and layers external to it

- Differ from bacterial cell envelopes in the molecular makeup and organization
- S-layer may be only component outside plasma membrane
- Some lack cell wall
- Slime layers are observed to mediate cell-cell interactions but little is known about composition and regulation
- Capsules and slime layers are rare but complex polysaccharides, proteins, or glycoproteins found in some other species
- No peptidoglycan, but some possess a peptidoglycan-like molecules called psuedomurein


## Archaeal Membranes

- Composed of unique lipids
- Hydrocarbons derived from isoprenes units

## Archaeal Membrane Lipids
2 Major types
1. Glycerol diether lipid
2. Diglyceral tetraether lipids


- Polar phospholipids, solfolipids, glycolipids, and unique lipids are also found in archaeal membranes

## Comparison of Archaeal and Bacterial Lipids and Membranes

Bacteria/Eukaryotes
- Fatty acids attached to glycerol by ester linkages

Archaea
- Branches chain hydrocarbons (isoprenoids) attaches to glycerol by ester linkages
## Archaeal Cell Walls
- Lack peptidogylcan
- Most common cell wall is S-layer
- May have protein sheath external to S-layer
- S-layer may be outside membrane and separated by pseudomurein
	- Pseudomurien may be outermost layer, similar to Gram-positive micro-organisms
	- Pseuomurein differs from peptidoglycan in that is has
		- L-amino acids, instead of D-amino acids in its cross-links
		- 

## Archaeal Cell Envelope Compositions

- Most common cell envelope in an S-layer composed of many copies of a single protein
- Some could have an extra protein or carbohydrate later above, below, or in place of the S-layer
- A few have a double membrane

1) Simple S-layer
2) S-layer + a carbohydrate layer
3) Carbohydrate layer below an S-layer
4) Carbohydrate (complex polysaccharide) instead of an S-layer
5) Double membrane without a cell wall

## Archaeal S-Layer Structure
- S-layer can be up to 70 nm thick
- Tethered to the plasma membrane
- Resembles a protein canopy from the side or a geometric pattern on the top
- S-layer proteins decorated with carbohydrates for stabilization


## Archaeal Extracellular Vesicles and Nanotubes
- Vesicles composed of the plasma membrane and the surrounding cell wall material, or simply the S-layer
- Cargo packed within includes cytoplasmic contents, proteins, and nucleic acids
- Thought to be important for intracellular gene transfer in thermophiles to protect DNA from denaturing in high temperatures


## Archaeal Cells and Nutrient Uptake
- Archaeal cells use many of the same mechanisms for nutrient uptake exhibited in bacteria
	- Passive and facilitated diffusion
	- Active transport (primary and secondary)
- The phosphoenolpyruvate
	- Sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) group translocation mechanisms has been found in some archaea

- All the usual components
	- Ribosomes
	- Nucleoid region
	- Plasmids
	- Inclusion bodies
	- Cytoskeletal proteins (homologues of tubulin and actin, but not of intermediate filaments)

## Ribosomes
- Archaeal ribosomes are the same size as bacterial ribosomes
	- 70s constructed as a 50S and 30S subunit
- Composition of archaeal ribosomes differs from bacterial ribosomes
	- rRNA molecules is similar size to bacteria, however, the nucleotide sequence is different
	- Protein composition differs
		- Archaeal ribosomes have more r-proteins
		- The different composition makes archaeal ribosomes unaffected by antibiotics that target the ribosomes
		- Archaea more similar to eukarya than bacteria, but there are some that are unique to archaea

## Nucleoid
**Nucleoid** - region in the cytoplasm that contains the circular chromosomes and nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs)
- Irregularly shaped region in bacteria and archaea

# 4.4 - Many Archaea Have External Structures Used for Attachment and Motility


## Archaeal External Structures

- Pili
	- Composed of pilin proteins that are made in the cytoplasm and then anchored to a protein complex in the plasma membrane
		- 2 archaeal pili
			- Cannulae
				- Hollow, tubelike structures on surface of thermophilic archaea
				- Shown that daughter cells that arise from cell division remain connected to each other by cannulae
			- Hami

## Archaella and Motility
- Archaea are thinner than flagella
	- Filament is not hollow
	- More then one type of flagellin protein
	- Archaellin (pilin) proteins are exported through the motor complex and added to the base, of the filament
	- More related to the type IV bacterial pili
	- Proteins anchor the archaellum to the plasma membrane and S-layer
- Movement is facilitated by archaellar rotation
	- Powered by ATP hydrolysis instead of proton motive force
