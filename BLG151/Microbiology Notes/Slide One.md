## Type of Microbial Cells
- 2 floor plants
	1) Prokaryotic
		- Single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles
		- Open floor plan
	2) Eukaryotic
		- Any cell or organism that processes a clearly defined nucleus
		- Have a membrane-enclosed nucleus
		- Larger and more morphologically complex

- A microbiologist and a biophysi

## Classification Schemes
- Based on a comparison of ribosomal RNA genes, divides microorganisms into

3 Domains:
1. Bacteria
2. Archaea
3. Eurkarya
