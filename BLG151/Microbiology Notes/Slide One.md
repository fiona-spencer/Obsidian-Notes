# 1.1 - Members of the Microbial World

---

- Microbiology is the study of microorganisms, their diversity and evolution, and their interactions with the world
- Organisms are acellular entities too small to be clearly seen by the unaided eye
	- <1 mm
	- Unicellular
	- Lack differentiated tissues

## Division and Types of Microbes

- Cellular
- Acellular

_*Most bacterial and archaea live in oceans and sediments_

## Type of Microbial Cells
- 2 floor plants
	1) Prokaryotic
		- Single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles
		- Open floor plan
	2) Eukaryotic
		- Any cell or organism that processes a clearly defined nucleus
		- Have a membrane-enclosed nucleus
		- Larger and more morphologically complex

Carl Woese
- A microbiologist and a biophysicist at the University of Illinois, demonstrated in 1977 by comparing 16S rRNA sequences that _Bacteria_ and _Archaea_ are two very different groups of organisms with prokaryotic cell architecture

## Classification Schemes
- Based on a comparison of ribosomal RNA genes, divides microorganisms into

3 Domains:
1. Bacteria
2. Archaea
3. Eurkarya

## Domain _Bacteria_ and Domain _Archaea_
Domain _Bacteria_
1) Usually single-celled
2) Majority have cell wall with peptidoglycan
3) Most lack a membrane-bound nucleus
4) Ubiquitous and some live in extreme environments
5) Cyanobacteria produced significant amounts of oxygen


Domain _Archaea_
1) Distinguished from _Bacteria_ by unique rRNA gene sequences
2) Lack peptidoglycan in cell walls
3) Have unique membrane lipids
4) Some have unusual metabolic characteristics
5) Many live in extreme environments

## Domain _Eukarya_
- Protists
	- Unicellular and sometimes colonial eukaryotic organisms that lack cellular differentiation into tissues
	- Chemo-organotrophic protists are referred to as protozoa
	- Phototrophic protists are referred to as algae
	- Generally larger than _Bacteria_ and _Archaea_
		-  Algae - photosynthetic (diatoms)
		- Protozoa - may be motile, "hunter, grazers"
		- Slime molds - two life cycle stages
		- Water molds - devastating disease in plants
- Fungi
	- Achlorophyllous, hetetrohpic, sporee-bearing eukaryotes with absorptive nutrition and a walled thallus
	- Yeast - unicellular
	- Molds and mushrooms - multicellualr

## Acellular Infectious Agents
- Viruses
	- An infectious agent having a simple acellular organization with a protein coat and a nucleic acid genome, lacking independent metabolism, and multipyling only within living host cells
- Viroids
	- Similar than viruses
	- An infectious agent that is a single-stranded RNA not associated with any protein
	- The RNA does not code for any protein and is not translated
	- Can only infect plants
- Satellites
	- Nucleic acid enclosed in protein shell
	- Must coinfect a host cell with a virus to complete life cycle
- Prions
	- An infectious agent consisting only or protein; prions cause a variety of spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie in sheep
	- Prion diseases can affect both human and animals
	- Spread to humans by infected meat produces
		- Most prion diseases predominantly or exclusively affect the nervous system, causing damage to brain tissue and leading to progressive, fatal dementia


# 1.2 - Microbes Have Evolved and Diversified for Billion of Years


---

Definition of Life:
1. Cells and organization
2. Response to environmental changes
3. Growth and development
4. Biological evolution
5. Energy use and metabolism
6. Regulation and homeostasis
7. Reproduction

## Overview of the History of Life on Earth
3.8 to 3.5 bya - first cells appeared
3.7 bya - fossils of primitive filamentous microbes
2.5 - to 2.0 bya - Eukaryotic cells
1.5 bya - multicellular eukaryotic organisms first appeared
533 to 525 mya - Cambrian explosion
520 mya - first vertebrates and first land plants appeared
450 mya - Large terrestrial colonization by plants and animals
300 mya - Reptiles first appeared
225 mya - dinosaurs and mammals first appeared
7 mya - hominids first appeared


## Relationship of DNA/RNA/Protein in Cells
Proteins
- Catalytic (enzymes)
- Structural
DNA
- Stores hereditary information that is replicated passed on to the next generation
RNA
- Molecule that acts as a messenger, taking information from DNA to then synthesizing proteins and other functions


## RNA World Hypothesis of the Origin of Life
- Original molecular must have fulfilled protein and hereditary function
- Ribozymes
	- RNA molecules that form peptide bonds
	- Perform cellular work and replication
- Earliest cells may have been RNA surrounded by liposomes

## Evidence of RNA World Hypothesis
- Most cellular RNA in modern cells exists in and is associated with the ribosome to construct proteins
	- rRNA
	- tRNA
	- mRNA
- Similar structures indicate RNA may be precursor to double stranded DNA
- The energy source of current cells if reibonucleotide (ATP)
- RNA can regulate gene expression

## Earliest Metabolism
- Early energy sources under harsh conditions


## Evolution of the 3 Domains of Life
- Universal phylogenetic tree
	- Based on comparisons of small rRNA (SSU rRNA)
	- Aligned rRNA sequences from diverse organisms are compared and differences counted to derive a value of evolutionary distanve
	- Relatedness, not time of divergence, determined this way

## Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)
- The root or origin of modern life is on bacterial branch but nature still controversial
- _Archaea_ and _Eukarya_ evolved independently of _Bacteria_


## Endosymbiotic Hypothesis
- Mitochondria originated from endosymbiotic proteobacteria
- Chloroplasts originated from endosymbiotic cynobacteria


## Evolution of Cellular Microbes
- Mutation of genetic material led to selected traits
- New genes and genotypes evolved, producing mosaic of genetic information
- _Bacteria_ and _Archaea_ increase genetic pool by horizontal gene transfer within the same generation

## Microbial Species
- _Bacteria_ and _Archaea_ do not reproduced sexually and are referred to as strains
- A strain consists of descendants of a single, pure microbial culture
- May be biovars, morphovars, serovars, and pathovars


## Microbial Species
- Binomial nomenclature
	- Genus - italicized and capitalized
	- Species - italicized but not capitalized

## Binomial System of Nomenclature
- Devised by Carolus Linnaeus



# 1.3 - Microbiology Advanced as New Tools for Studying Microbes Were Developed

Study of microorganisms
- Microscopes
- Culture techniques
- Molecular genetics
- Genomics

## Important Events in Microbiology (1665 to 1911)
- 1st golden age of microbiology (mid 1800s to early 1900s)
	- An era of many important discoveries which led to rapid led to expansion of microbiology
- 2nd golden age of microbiology
	- Rapid expansion of knowledge ~1940s
	- Included the expansion molecular biology and molecular genetics



## Discovery of Microorganisms
Earliest microscopic observations
1. Francesco Stelluti
	- Earliest microscopic observation of organisms
	- Bees and weevils/beetles
	- Between 1625 to 1630
2. Robert Hooke
	1. 
3. Antony van Leeuwenhoek

## The Conflict Over Spontaneous Generation
Spontaneous generation
- Idea that living organisms can develop from nonliving or decomposing matter

Francesco Redi (1626 to 1697)
- Discredited spontaneous generation
- Showed that maggots on decaying meat come from fly eggs and not from the decaying meat itself

John Needham (1713 to 1781)
- His experiement supported spontaneous generation
	- 

Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729 to 1799)
## Louis Pasteur (1822 to 1895)
- 'Swan-neck flask' experiment
	- Placed nutrient solution in flasks
	- Created flasks with long, curved necks
	- Boiled the solutions
	- Left flasks exposes to air
	- Result: no growth of microogranisms


## Swan-Necked Flask Experiment of Pasteur
- Microbes are destroyed 

## More on Evidence of Disprove the Theory of Spontaneous Generation
John Tyndall (1820 to 1893)
- Demonstrated that dust carries microorganisms
- Showed that if dust was absent, nutrient broths remained sterile, even it directly exposed to air
- Also provided evidence for the existence of exceptionally heat-resistant forms of bacteria
	- Tyndallization, a method of destroying spores


Ferdinand Cohn (1823 to 1898)
- Heat-resistant bacteria could produce endospores


## The Role of Microorganisms in Disease
- Infectious disease believed to be due to supernatural forces of imbalances of 4 bodily fluid "humors"
- Established connection depended on development of techniques for studying microbes

## Early Evidence for the Relationship Between Microorganisms and Disease

Agostino Bassi (1773 to 1856)

M.J. Berkeley (1803 to 1889)

Heinrich de Bary (1831 to 1888)



## Further Early Evidence for the Relationship Between Microorganisms and Disease

Louis Pasteur (1822 to 1895)


Joesph Lister (1827 to 1912)
- Provided indirect evidence that microorganisms were the causal agents of disease
- Developed an antiseptic surgery system to prevent microorganisms from entering wounds
- His patients has fewer postoperative infections


## Final Proof
Robert Koch (1843 to 1910)
- Established the relationship between _Bacillus anthracis_ and anthrax
- Used criteria developed by his teacher Jacob Henle (1809 to 1885)
- These criteria known as "Koch's postulates" are still used today to establish the link between a particular microorganisms and a particular disease


## Koch's Experiments Leading to the Development of Koch's Postulates
1. Microorganisms must be present in every case of the disease but absent from healthy organisms
2. The suspected microorganisms must be isolated and grown in a pure culture
3. The same disease must result when the isolated microorganism is inoculated into a healthy host
4. The same microorganism must be isolated again from the diseased host



## Limitation of Koch's Postulates
- Some organisms cannot be grown in pure culture
- Using humans in completing the postulates is unethical
- Molecular and genetic evidence may replace and overcome these limits

## The Development of Techniques for Studying Microbial Pathogens
- Koch's work led to discovery or development of:
	- Agar, Petri dishes, nutrient broth and nutrient agar, methods for isolating microorganisms
	- 

Charles Chamberland (1851 to 1908)
- Developed porcelain bacterial filters used by Ivanoski and Beijerinck to study tabacco mosaic disease
	- Determines


## Other Developments
Pasteur and Emile Roux
- Discovered that incubation of cultures for long intervals between transfers caused pathogens to lose their ability to cause disease ("attenuation")
Pasteur and his coworkers
- Developed vaccines for chicken cholera, anthrax, and rabies

## Immunological Studies
- Led to study of host defense, immunology

Edward Jenner (1749)


## Microbial Ecology

Sergei Winogradsky (1856 to 1953) and Martinus Beijerinck (1851 to 1931)
- Studied soil microorganisms and discovered numerous interesting metabolic processes
	- Nitrogen fixation
- Pioneered to use of enrichment cultures and selective media

Winogradsky column
- A wetland model ecosystem containing region of enrishment for microbes of diverse metabolism
