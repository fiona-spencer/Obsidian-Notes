## Bacteria Use Rapid Transport

- Microbes with small genomes that can multiply rapidly and cause damage to human tissue is largely due the diversity of their transporters

**Transporters** - molecular gates that control which molecules enter to leave the cell

## Transporter Proteins

- Entry to the bacterial cell is controlled by transport proteins embedded in cell's membrane

Specific for one type of molecule
- Ions
- Amino acids
- Vitamins
- Sugars


## Group A Streptococci (GAS)
- Can cause a range of infections including strep throat or necrotizing fasciitis/flesh eating disease
- In flesh eating disease, GAS grows primarily in skeletal muscle (made largely from protein)
- GAS can also secrete proteases (enzymes that break down proteins)


# 3.1 - Use of the Term _Prokaryote is Controversial_


## Prokaryotes Term Should be Abandoned

- Originally defined in 1962 by the characteristics they lack compared to eukaryotes

Lack:
- Membrane-bound nucleus
- A cytoskeleton
- Membrane-bound organelles
- Internal membranous structures

- Since the 1960s, biochemical, genetic, and genomic analysis have show that _Bacteria_ and _Archaea_ are distinct from each other
- Normal pace proposed in 2006 that this term should be abandoned

- Prokaryotes are know referred to Eukarya and Archaea


# 3.2 - Bacteria are Diverse, but Share Some Common Features

## Shape, Arrangement, and Size

### Shape
- Cocci - spherical cells
- Rods - oblong cells

### Arrangement
 - Determined by plane of division
 - Determined by separation or not

## Cocci Shape and Arrangement

**Cocci** - spheres that can be single or can be associated in arrangements that is useful for identification
**Diplococci** - divide and remain in pairs
**Streptococci** - divide in 1 plant to form chains
**Staphylococci** - divide in random planes making grape-like clusters


## Other Shapes and Aggregations

**Bacilli** - rods
**Vibrios** - Comma shaped
**Spirilla** - rigid spiral-shaped
**Spirochetes** - flexible spiral-shaped helices
**Caulobacter** -Possesses stalks (adherence to surfaces)
**Mycelium** - Comma shaped
**Myxobacteria** - Comma shaped
**Pleomorphic** - Comma shaped

## Bacterial Cell Size
- Sizes of bacteria relative to red blood cell and viruses

## Size Extremes in Bacteria
- Smallest size (_Mycoplasma_) - 0.3 µm
- Average rod (_E. coli_) - 1.1 to 1.5 µm
- Very large (_Epulopiscium fisheloni_) - 600 by 80 µm


## _Thiomargarita namibiensis_ - Supersized microbial cells

- Gram-negative coccoid bacterium
- Found in the ocean sediments off the continental shelf of Namibia
- The largest bacterium ever discovered


## Size-Shape Relationship

- Cells want a high surface area-to-volume ratio (S/V ratio)
	- Increases efficiency of nutrient uptake and diffusion of molecules within a cells
	- Increased nutrient uptake => increased growth rate
- The S/V ratio is an important determinant of cell size
- Surface area = $4\pi{r^2}$
- Volume = $4/3\pi{r^3}$

## Common Bacterial Structures
- Cell envelope
	- Plasma membrane
	- Cell wall
	- Additional layers (capsule, or slime layer)
- Cytoplasm
- External structures
- Nucleoid
- Pili
- Flagella

- No single bacterium always possesses all the structures
- Some are found only in certain cells or during certain phases of the cell's life cycle

## Bacterial Structures and Their Functions

### Plasma Membrane
- Selectively permeable barrier
- Mechanical boundary of cell
- Nutrient and waste transport
- Location of many metabolic processes (respiration, photosynthesis)
- Detection of environmental cues of chemotaxis

### Gas Vacuole
- An inclusion that provides buoyancy for floating in aquatic environments
### Ribosomes
- Protein synthesis
### Inclusions
- Storage of carbon, phosphate, and other substance
- Site of chemical reactions (micro-compartments)
- Movement
### Nucleoid
### Periplasmic space
### Cell wall
### Capsules and slime layers
### Fimbriae and pili
### Flagella
### Endospore


## Bacterial Cell Enevlope

**Cell envelope** - the plasma membrane and all of the surrounding layers externa to it

Includes
1. Plasma membrane
2. Cel wall
3. At least one addition layer
	1. Capsule
	2. Slime layer


## Plasma Membrane Functions
- Most important membrane that is required of all living organisms
- Innermost membrane that encompasses the cytoplasm


## Plasma Membrane Structure is Dynamic
- Fluid mosaic model of Singer and Nicholson
- Lipid bilayer (2-3 nm thick) composed of two sheets of lipid molecules arranged end to end, in which proteins float

## Membrane Proteins
2 Types
1) Peripheral membrane proteins
	- Loosely connected to the membrane and easily removed
	- 20 to 30% of total membrane proteins
2) Integral membrane proteins
	- Amphipathic proteins that are embedded within membrane and not easily removed
	- Hydrophobic region buried in membrane lipids
	- Hydrophilic regions project from the surfae
	- Carry out important functions (transport)

## Structure of a Phospholipif

Amphiphatic lipids
- Hydrophilic
	- Polar end that
