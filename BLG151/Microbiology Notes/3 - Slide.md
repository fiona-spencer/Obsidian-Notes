## Bacteria Use Rapid Transport

- Microbes with small genomes that can multiply rapidly and cause damage to human tissue is largely due the diversity of their transporters

**Transporters** - molecular gates that control which molecules enter to leave the cell

## Transporter Proteins

- Entry to the bacterial cell is controlled by transport proteins embedded in cell's membrane

Specific for one type of molecule
- Ions
- Amino acids
- Vitamins
- Sugars

Other transporter export:
- Communication
- Toxicity
- Waste products

## Group A Streptococci (GAS)
- Can cause a range of infections including strep throat or necrotizing fasciitis/flesh eating disease
- In flesh eating disease, GAS grows primarily in skeletal muscle (made largely from protein)
- GAS can also secrete proteases (enzymes that break down proteins)


# 3.1 - Use of the Term _Prokaryote is Controversial_

## Prokaryotes Term Should be Abandoned

- Originally defined in 1962 by the characteristics they lack compared to eukaryotes

Lack:
- Membrane-bound nucleus
- A cytoskeleton
- Membrane-bound organelles
- Internal membranous structures

- Since the 1960s, biochemical, genetic, and genomic analysis have show that _Bacteria_ and _Archaea_ are distinct from each other
- Norman pace proposed in 2006 that this term should be abandoned

- Prokaryotes are know referred to Eukarya and Archaea


# 3.2 - Bacteria are Diverse, but Share Some Common Features

## Shape, Arrangement, and Size

### Shape
- Cocci - spherical cells
- Rods - oblong cells





### Arrangement
 - Determined by plane of division
 - Determined by separation or not

## Cocci Shape and Arrangement

**Cocci** - spheres that can be single or can be associated in arrangements that is useful for identification
**Diplococci** - divide and remain in pairs
**Streptococci** - divide in 1 plant to form chains
**Staphylococci** - divide in random planes making grape-like clusters
**Sarcina** - divide in 2 planes forming a square of 4 cocci
**Tetrads** - divide in 3 planes making cubic packet of 8 cocci


![](Pasted%20image%2020250521141412.png)

## Other Shapes and Aggregations

**Bacilli** - rods
**Vibrios** - Comma shaped
**Spirilla** - rigid spiral-shaped
**Spirochetes** - flexible spiral-shaped helices
**Caulobacter** -Possesses stalks (adherence to surfaces)
**Mycelium** - Comma shaped

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521141526.png)

## Bacterial Cell Size
- Sizes of bacteria relative to red blood cell and viruses

## Size Extremes in Bacteria
- Smallest size (_Mycoplasma_) - 0.3 µm
- Average rod (_E. coli_) - 1.1 to 1.5 µm
- Very large (_Epulopiscium fisheloni_) - 600 by 80 µm


## _Thiomargarita namibiensis_ - Supersized microbial cells

- Gram-negative coccoid bacterium
- Found in the ocean sediments off the continental shelf of Namibia
- The largest bacterium ever discovered


## Size-Shape Relationship

- Cells want a high surface area-to-volume ratio (S/V ratio)
	- Increases efficiency of nutrient uptake and diffusion of molecules within a cells
	- Increased nutrient uptake => increased growth rate
- The S/V ratio is an important determinant of cell size
- Surface area = $4\pi{r^2}$
- Volume = $4/3\pi{r^3}$

## Common Bacterial Structures and Their Functions

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521141819.png)

### Plasma Membrane
- Selectively permeable barrier

## Bacterial Cell Enevlope

**Cell envelope** - the plasma membrane and all of the surrounding layers externa to it

Includes
1. Plasma membrane
2. Cel wall
3. At least one addition layer
	1. Capsule
	2. Slime layer

## Plasma Membrane Functions (Levels)
- Most important membrane that is required of all living organisms
- Innermost membrane that encompasses the cytoplasm
- Selectively permeable barrier that acquires nutrients and eliminates waste
- Interacts with external environment
	- Detects and responds to surrounding chemicals
	- Transport systems used for nutrient uptake
	- Metabolic processes (respiration, and photosynthesis)

## Plasma Membrane Structure is Dynamic
- Fluid mosaic model of Singer and Nicholson
- Lipid bilayer (2-3 nm thick) composed of two sheets of lipid molecules arranged end to end, in which proteins float

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521142207.png)


## Membrane Proteins
2 Types
1) Peripheral membrane proteins
	- Loosely connected to the membrane and easily removed
	- 20 to 30% of total membrane proteins
2) Integral membrane proteins
	- Amphipathic proteins that are embedded within membrane and not easily removed
	- Hydrophobic region buried in membrane lipids
	- Hydrophilic regions project from the surface
	- Carry out important functions (transport)

## Structure of a Phospholipif

Amphiphatic lipids
- Hydrophilic
	- Polar end that interact with water
- Hydrophobic
	- Non-polar tails that are insoluble in water and interact with each other

- Bilayer forms spontaneously in aqueous environments
	- Hydrophilic on surface
	- Hydrophobic ends buried


![](Pasted%20image%2020250521142356.png)



## Bacterial Lipids
- The plasma membrane is mainly composed of phospholipids

Other smaller lipids
- Haponoids - Hydrophobic molecule similar to cholesterol
- Distort the bilayer, which impacts the fluidity and shape in membrane regions
- Form functional membrane micro-domains that are platforms for protein complex assembly

![](Pasted%20image%2020250521142507.png)
## Definition

**Selective Permeability Barrier** - controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell, allowing nutrients in and waste products out
**Energy generation** - site of the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation or photophosphorylation (in photosynthetic bacteria), since bacteria lack mitochondria
**Transport systems** - Contains various transport proteins for active and passive movement of molecules, including ion channels, symporters, and ABC transporters
**Biosynthesis of Cell Wall Components** - enzymes involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycan and other cell wall components are embedded in or associated with the membrane
**Secretion of Proteins** - plays a role in exporting proteins (toxins, enzymes) outside the cell via specialized secretion systems
**Cell Signalling and Chemotaxis** - hosts sensor proteins and receptors that detect environmental signals and help respond appropriately
**Lipid and Other Biosynthesis** - invovled in the synthesis of phospholipids and other membrane components


# 3.4 - Cell Walls Have Many Functions

## Bacterial Cell Wall
Functions
- Maintains shape of the bacterium
- Helps protect cell from osmotic lysis and toxic materials
- May contribute to pathogenicity

**Peptidoglycan (murien)** - Rigid structure lying outside the plasma membrane


2 Type of bacteria based on Gram Stain
1. Gram-positive: Stain purple (thick peptidoglycan)
	1. Monoderm - single membrane
2. Gram-negative: stain pink or red (thin peptidoglycan)
	1. Diderm - plasma membrane and an outer membrane

## 2 Major Types of Cells Walls: Gram-Negative and Gram-Positive

- Cell envelopes consist of plasma membrane and any layers exterior to it
- Slime layers, capsules, and S-layers are common additional layers that lie outside the cell wall

_Staphylococcus aureus_ - has a typical Gram-positive cell wall that consists primariliy of peptidoglycan

_Myxococcus xanthus_ - has a typical Gram-negative cell wall consisting of a thin layer of peptidoglycan, an outer membrane, and the periplasmic space


## Peptidoglycan Structure
- Meshlike polymer of identical subunits forming long strands
- 2 alternating sugars
	- _NAG_
	- _NAM_

## Strands Are Cross-Linked

- Peptidoglycan strands have a helical shape
- Peptidoglycan chains are cross- linked by peptides for strength


## Gram-Positive Cell Walls
- Composed primarily of peptidoglycan

## Periplasmic Space of Gram-Positive Bacteria
- Between plasma membrane and cell wall
- Periplasm has relatively few proteins

## Gram-Negative Cell Wall Basic Structure
- More complex than Gram-positive
- Consist of a thin layer of peptidoglycan surrounded by an outer membrane
- Outer membrane composed of lipids, lipoproteins, and lipopolysaccharides
- No teichoic acids

## Gram-Negative Cell Walls
- Outer membrane (OM) outside thin peptidoglycan layer
- Braun's lipoproteins connect OM to peptidoglycan
- Peptidoglycan is ~5 to 10% of call walls weight

## LPS - Lipopolysaccharide
3 Parts
1) Lipid A - buired in outer membrane
2) Core polysaccharide - 10 sugar structure joined to Lipid A
3) O side chain (O antigen) - polysaccharide that extends outward form the core

## Gram-Negative Membrane Transport
2 Step Process
1. Solute crosses the outer membrane into the periplasm
2. Then, crosses the plasma membrane

- Facilitated transport by porins


## Mechanisms of Gram Stain Reaction
- Gram stain reaction due to nature of cell wall
- Shrinkage of the pores of peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive cells
	- Constriction prevents loss of crystal violet during decolourization step
- Thinner peptidoglycan layer and larger pores of Gram-negative bacteria do not prevent loss of crystal violet
	- Alcohol may also remove/extract some lipids from outer layer of Gram-negative cell wall, making crystal violet dye removal easier

## Cell Walls and Osmotic Protection
- Hypotonic environments
- Hypertonic environments


**Plasmolysis** - the process where a plant cell's cytoplasm shrinks away from its cell wall due to water loss in a hypertonic solution


## Evidence for Protection of Cell Wall
- Lysosomes break bonds between NAG and NAM
- Penicillin inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis
- If cells are treated with either of the above, they lyse in a hypotonic solution

**Protoplast Formation and Lysis** - protoplast formation induced by incubation with penicillin in an isotonic medium
- Transfer to a hypotonic medium will result in lysis


## Cells That Lose a Cell Wall May Survive in Isotonic Environments
**Protoplasts** - Gram-positive that lose cell walls in isotonic environments
**Spheroplasts** - Gram-positive cells that lose cell wall (outer membrane remains) in isotonic environments
**Mycoplasm** - Lack a cell wall, but plasma membrane more resistant to osmotic pressure



# 3.5 - Extracellular Vesicles Emerge from Bacterial Membranes


## Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)
- Small membrane-bound particles (20 to 400 nm in size)
- Develop when a membrane buds out, pinches off, and is released from the cell
- Gram-Postive EV, made of the plasma membrane surrounding a small amount of cytoplasm
- Gram-negative Ev, made of LPS-containing OM surrounding a sample of periplasm

## Extracellular Vesicles Are Not Cells
- They do not reproduce
- Can carry some ATP, but do not have the ability to conserve energy
- Play role in cell-cell interactions
	- Transfer genetic information between cells
	- Transfer toxin molecules


# 3.6 - The Cell Envelope Often Includes Layers Outside the Cell Wall

## Components Outside of the Cell Wall

- Slime may facilitate motility

## Components Outside of Cell Wall - S Layers
- Regularly structured self-assembling layers of protein or glycoprotein
- In Gram-negative, S layer adheres to outer membrane
- In Gram-positive, associated with peptidoglycan

S-Layer Functions
- Protect from ion and pH fluctuations, osmotic stress, enzymes, and predation
- Maintains shape and rigidity
- Promotes adhesion to surfaces
- Protects from host defences
- Potential use in nanotechnology

- Granules, crystals, or globules of organic or inorganic material that are stockpiled by the cell for future use
- Some are enclosed by a single-layered protein or lipid shell
	- May be referred to as _microcompartments_


## Microcompartments

- Composed of "scaffold proteins", foind in CO2 fixing bacteria
	- Cyanobacteria

**Carboxysomes** - CO2 fixing bacteria

- Contain the enzyme carbonic anhydrase that release CO2 into a shell so it accumulates to high concentration
- Then RuBisCo makes sugar

## Gas Vacuoles
- Involved in bacterial movement
- Are aggregates of high number of cylindrical gas vesicles
	- Gas vesicles have rigid protein walls impermeable to water but permeable to atmospheric gases
- Are found in aquatic photosynthetic bacteria and archaea
- Help cells to regulate their buoyancy at water column depth appropriate for optimal light intensity, oxygen and nutrient concentration
	- Cells float downwards by collapsing their gas vesicles, when new vesicles are build, cells float upwards
