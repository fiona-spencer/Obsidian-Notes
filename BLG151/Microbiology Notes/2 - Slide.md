# 2.1 - Lenses Create Images By Bending Light

---

## Microbial Size

- Microbes differ in size, over a range of a few orders of magnitude

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507181245.png)

- _Prochloroccus_ are small (0.6 μm)


## Light Microscopes
- Light microscopes were the first microscope invented

## Lenses Create Images by Bending Light
- Light is refracted when passing from one medium to another

**Refractive index** - A measure o how much a substance slows the velocity of light

## Lenses
- Focus light ray at a specific place called the focal point
- Distance between centre of lens and focal point is the focal length
- Lens strength is related to focal length
	- Short focal length = more magnification

# 2.2 - Several Types of Light Microscopes

---

## Light Microscope Varieties
1) Bright-field microscope
2) Dark-field microscope
3) Phase-contrast microscope
4) Fluorescence microscope
5) Confocal microscope

Compound Microscopes
- Two sets of lenses

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507182636.png)

### Bright-Field Microscope
- Produces a dark image against a brighter background
- Several objective lenses producing different magnification
- Parfocal microscopes remain in focus when objectives are changed
- Total magnification is the product of magnification of the ocular lenses and objective lenses

Ex. 10x (ocular) x 40 (objective) = Total mag. of 400x

### Better Microscope Resolution Means a Clearer Image

**Resolution** - Ability of a lens to separate or distinguish small objects that are close together, rather than a single larger object
- Defined as the "shortest distance between two points on a specimen that can still be distinguished by observer or camera system as separate entities"
- Wavelength of light used is major factor in resolution
- Shorter wavelength = greater resolution

## Numerical Aperture
- The property of a microscope lens that determines how much light can enter and how great the resolution can be
- Ernst Abbe (1873) - published optical theory underlying microscope design
- Resolution is the ability to distinguish 2 objects
	- Abbe Equation = $d = \frac{0.5λ}{nsinθ}$

$d$ = the minimum resolution distance between two objects that reveals them as separate entities
$λ$ = wavelength of light
$nsinθ$ = numerical aperture (NA)
$n$ = index of refraction of the medium
$θ$ = the half-angle of the maximum cone of light that can enter or exit the lens

- The numerical aperture (NA) is the most important number associated with the light gathering ability of an objective or condenser

## Resolution
- To increate the resolving power, we need to decrease d
- The greatest resolution is obtained with the largest possible NA and light of the shortest $λ$ (blue)

- The maximum theoretical resolution power of a microscope when viewing a specimen using an oil immersion objective (NA of 1.25) and blue green light is ~0.2μm

$d = [(0.5)(530nm)]/1.25 = 212 nm$

- At best a bright field microscope can distinguish between two dots about 0.2μm

## Working Distance
- Distance between the front surface of lens and surface of cover glass or specimen when it is in sharp focus
- Shorter working distance = better resolution

## The Oil Immersion Object
- Results in an increase in numerical aperture and resolution

## Visualizing Living, Unstained Microbes
- Many microbes are not coloured
- Un-pigmented microbes are not visible since there is not enough contrast between the cells, sub-cellular structures, and water

3 Light Microscopes that can be used on Unpigmented Microbes
1) Dark field microscope
2) Phase-contract microscope
3) Differential interference contract (DIC) microscope

## The Dark-Field Microscope
- Image is formed by light reflected or refracted by specimen
- Produced a bright image of the object against a dark background
  user to observe living, unstained preparations
	- Internal structures in eukaryotic microorganisms
	- Bacteria such as _Treponema pallidum_, the causative agent of syphilis

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507184455.png)


## The Phase-Contract Microscope
- Converts differences in refractive index/cell density into detected variations in light intensity
- Can be used to observe unstained, living cells
- Produces an image of a dark microbe against a light background
- Deviated and undeviated light are combined in a condenser to generate an image
- Observe microbial movement and detecting bacterial structures

## Production of Contrast in Phase-Contract Microscopy

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507184916.png)

## The Differential Interference Contrast Microscope (DIC)
- Creates images by detecting differences in refractive indices and thickness of different parts of specimen
- Image is bright specimen that seems to pop out from backgroun
- Used to observe cell walls, endospores, granules, vacuoles, and nuclei

## The Fluorescence Microscope
- Shows a bright image of the object resulting from fluorescent light emitted by the specimen
- Produces image by exciting a speciment with a wavelength of light that triggers the object to emit fluorescence light
- Microbe is stained by fluorochromes that absorb light and emit visible fluorescent light
- Essential tool in microbiology
	- Fluorochrome-labeled probes
		- Antibodies (detects specific antigen)
		- Fluorochrome dyes tag specific cell constituents for identification of unknown pathogens
		- Localization of specific proteins in cells

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507185442.png)


## Confocal Microscopy
- Uses a laser beam to illuminate a fluorescently labeled specimen
- Confocal scanning laser microscopy creates sharp, composite 3D image of specimens by using an aperture that eliminates stray light outside of the plane of focus
- Numerous applications including study of biofilms

- Sharper image using the monochromatic light, unlike light microscopes that use broad-spectrum light source (halogen or LED)

_What is the maximum theoretical resolving power when viewing a specimen when an oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.25 and blue/green light?_

$d = \frac{0.5(500 nm)}{2(1.25)} = 200 nm$


# 2.3 - Staining Helps to Visualize and Identify Microbes

---

## Preparation and Staining of Specimens
- Increases visibility of specimen
- Accentuates specific morphological features
- Preserves specimen for future research

## Fixation
- Stained to resemble living cells as closely as possible

**Fixation** - preserves internal and external structures and fixing them in position

- This is done by inactivating enzymes that can disturb cell morphology and toughens cell structures
- Organisms are kills and firmly attaches to microscope slide

2 Types of Fixation
1) Heat fixation
	- Preserves overall morphology but destroys internal structures
2) Chemical fixation
	- Protects fine cellular substructures and morphology

## Dyes and Simple Staining

- Dyes make internal and external structures of cell more visible by increasing contrast with background


| Types of Dye | Examples | Chromophore Characteristics |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Basic dyes   |          |                             |
| Acidic dyes  |          |                             |


## Basic/Acid Dyes and Simple Staining
- Ionizable dyes have charged groups
	- Basic dyes have positive charges
		- Binds to negatively charged components within cells
			- Nucleic acid
			- Some proteins
	- Acid dyes have negative charges
		- Binds to and stains basic structures
			- Cytoplasm
			- Collagen
			- Muscle fibers

Simple staining
- A single stain is used
- Used to determine size, shape, and arrangement of bacteria

## Differential Staining
- Divides organisms into groups based on their staining properties
	- Gran stain
	- Acid-fast stain
- Differential stain used to detect presence or absence of structures
	- Capsules
	- Flagells


## Gram Staining
- Most widely used differential staining procedure
- Devised by Hans Christian Gram (1884)
- Divides bacteria into 2 groups based on differences in cell wall structure
	- Gram-positive (purple)
		- Bacteria retain the crystal violet stain because of their thicker cell wall
	- Gram-negative (red)
		- Bacteria do not, they take up safranin, the counterstain in this procedure


Gram-Staining Procedure
1) Wash with crystal violet, water rinse
2) Iodine, water rinse
3) Alcohol (decolorizer), water rinse
4) Safranin (counterstain), water rinse


![](Pasted%20image%2020250507193913.png)

- Decolorization step is considered the most critical in the Gram-staining procedure
- Determines whether bacteria is Gram-positive or Gram-negative
- By retaining or removing the crystal violet stain
- Over-decolorizing can wash out stain from Gram-positive cells, making them appear negative, while under-decolorizing can cause Gram-negative cells to retain the purple


## Acid-Fast Staining
- Useful for staining members of the genus _Mycobacterium_
- Mycobacteria have a cell wall with lipids that prevent dyes from binding to cells
- Ziehl-Neelson method of staining uses concentrated phenol and carbol fuchsin to drive the stain into the cell

## Staining Specific Structures
Capsule staining - using to visualize polysaccharide capsules surrounding bacteria
Negative stain - capsules may be colourless against a stained background
Flagella staining - used to provide information about the presence and distribution pattern of flagella
- Mordant is applied to increase thickness of flagella because they are usually too fine to be observed

# 2.4 - Electron Microscopes Use Beams of Electrons to Create Highly Magnified Images

---

## Limits of Microscopic Resolution
- Some organisms are too small to be seen using a light microscope

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507195049.png)


## Electron Microscopy
- Electrons replace light as the "illuminating" beam that is focused
- Wavelength of electron beam is 100,000x shorter than visible light, resulting in a higher resolution image
- Allows for microbial morphology to be studied in detail

## Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
- Uses a heat tungsten filament in the electron gun to generate a focused beam of electron on the specimen
- Electrons that pass through the specimen form the image
	- Denser regions scatter electrons more and appear darker
- Process is under vacuum to reduce scatter and produce clear image
- Cannot use living specimens
- Cannot produce 3D images

## A Comparison of Light and Transmission Electron Microscope

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507195558.png)

## Characteristics of Light and Transmission Electron Microscopes


## Specimen Preparation
- Analogous to procedures used for light microscopy
- For TEM, specimens must be but very thin because electron beams are easily absorbed and scattered by solid matter
- Specimens are chemically fixed and stained with electron dense materials, such as heavy metals, that differentially scatter electrons

## Other Preparation Methods
Negative staining
- Specimen spread out in a thin film with chemicals
- Produces images bright against a dark background
- Used for study of viruses and cellular microbes
Shadowing
- Specimen is coated with a heavy metal on one side
- Useful of virus particle morphology, flagella, and DNA

## Preparations Methods without Metals
Freeze-etching
- Rapidly freeze cells in liquid nitrogen
- Frozen cells are brittle and fracture along lines of greatest weakness (internal membranes)
- Allows for observation of shapes of intracellular structures

## Electron Microscopy (EM) of COVID-19
- SARS-CoV-2 has a distinct shape when viewed in EM
- Proteins extending from surface give each a crownlike or corona appearance
- 100 nm in diameter

## Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
- Produces a realistic 3D image of specimen's surface features
- Uses electrons excited from the surface of specimen to create detailed image
- Narrow electron beam scanned back and forth over a specimen, producing secondary electrons that generates an electrical current that is digitalized
- 

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507200648.png)

## Cryo-Electron Microscopy
- Used to visualized biomolecules and generate high resolution structures
- Samples rapidly frozen, then multiple TEM images are captured at different angles
- Images combine to generate 3D images



# 2.5 - Scanning Probe Microscopy Can Visualize Molecules and Atoms
