## Microbial Size

- Microbes differ in size, over a range of a few orders of magnitude

- _Prochloroccus_ are small (0.6 Î¼m)


## Light Microscopes
- Light microscopes were the first microscope invented

## Lenses Create Images by Bending Light
- Light is refracted when passing from one medium to another

**Refractive index** - A measure o how much a substance slows the velocity of light

## Lenses
- Focus light ray at a specific place called the focal point
- Distance between centre of lens and focal point is the focal length
- Lens strength is related to focal length
	- Short focal length = more magnification

# 2.2 - Several Types of Light Microscopes

---

## Light Microscope Varieties
1) Bright-field microscope
2) Dark-field microscope
3) Phase-contrast microscope
4) Fluorescence microscope
5) Confocal microscope

Compound Microscopes
- Two sets of lenses

### Bright-Field Microscope
- Produces a dark image against a brighter background
- Several objective lenses producing different magnification
- Parfocal microscopes remain in focus when objectives are changed
- Total magnification is the product of magnification of the ocular lenses and objective lenses

### Better Microscope Resolution Means a Clearer Image


**Resolution** - Ability of a lens to separate or distinguish small objects that are close together, rather than a single larger object
