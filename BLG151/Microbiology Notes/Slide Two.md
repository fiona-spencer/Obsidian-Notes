# 2.1 - Lenses Create Images By Bending Light

## Microbial Size

- Microbes differ in size, over a range of a few orders of magnitude

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507181245.png)

- _Prochloroccus_ are small (0.6 μm)


## Light Microscopes
- Light microscopes were the first microscope invented

## Lenses Create Images by Bending Light
- Light is refracted when passing from one medium to another

**Refractive index** - A measure o how much a substance slows the velocity of light

## Lenses
- Focus light ray at a specific place called the focal point
- Distance between centre of lens and focal point is the focal length
- Lens strength is related to focal length
	- Short focal length = more magnification

# 2.2 - Several Types of Light Microscopes

## Light Microscope Varieties
1) Bright-field microscope
2) Dark-field microscope
3) Phase-contrast microscope
4) Fluorescence microscope
5) Confocal microscope

Compound Microscopes
- Two sets of lenses

### Bright-Field Microscope
- Produces a dark image against a brighter background
- Several objective lenses producing different magnification
- Parfocal microscopes remain in focus when objectives are changed
- Total magnification is the product of magnification of the ocular lenses and objective lenses

Ex. 10x (ocular) x 40 (objective) = Total mag. of 400x

### Better Microscope Resolution Means a Clearer Image

**Resolution** - Ability of a lens to separate or distinguish small objects that are close together, rather than a single larger object
- Defined as the "shortest distance between two points on a specimen that can still be distinguished by observer or camera system as separate entities"
- Wavelength of light used is major factor in resolution
- Shorter wavelength = greater resolution

## Numerical Aperture
- The property of a microscope lens that determines how much light can enter and how great the resolution can be
- Ernst Abbe (1873) - published optical theory underlying microscope design
- Resolution is the ability to distinguish 2 objects
	- Abbe Equation = $d = \frac{0.5λ}{nsinθ}$

$d$ = the minimum resolution distance between two objects that reveals them as separate entities
$λ$ = wavelength of light
$nsinθ$ = numerical aperture (NA)
$n$ = index of refraction of the medium
$θ$ = the half-angle of the maximum cone of light that can enter or exit the lens

- The numerical aperture (NA) is the most important number associated with the light gathering ability of an objective or condenser

## Resolution
- To increate the resolving power, we need to decrease d
- The greatest resolution is obtained with the largest possible NA and light of the shortest $λ$ (blue)

- The maximum theoretical resolution power of a microscope when viewing a specimen using an oil immersion objective (NA of 1.25) and blue green light is ~0.2μm

$d = [(0.5)(530nm)]/1.25 = 212 nm$

- At best a bright field microscope can distinguish between two dots about 0.2μm

## Working Distance
- Distance between the front surface of lens and surface of cover glass or specimen when it is in sharp focus
- Shorter working distance = better resolution

## The Oil Immersion Object
- Results in an increase in numerical aperture and resolution

## Visualizing Living, Unstained Microbes
- Many microbes are not coloured
- Un-pigmented microbes are not visible since there is not enough contrast between the cells, sub-cellular structures, and water

3 Light Microscopes that can be used on Unpigmented Microbes
1) Dark field microscope
2) Phase-contract microscope
3) Differential interference contract (DIC) microscope

## The Dark-Field Microscope
- Image is formed by light reflected or refracted by specimen
- Produced a bright image of the object against a dark background
  user to observe living, unstained preparations
	- Internal structures in eukaryotic microorganisms
	- Bacteria such as _Treponema pallidum_, the causative agent of syphilis

## The Phase-Contract Microscope
- Converts differences in refractive index/cell density into detected variations in light intensity
- Can be used to observe unstained, living cells
- Produces an image of a dark microbe against a light background
- Deviated and undeviated light are combined in a condenser to generate an image
- Observe microbial movement and detecting bacterial structures

## Production of Contrast in Phase-Contract Microscopy

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507184916.png)

## The Differential Interference Contrast Microscope (DIC)
- Creates images by detecting differences in refractive indices and thickness of different parts of specimen
- Image is bright specimen that seems to pop out from backgroun
- Used to observe cell walls, endospores, granules, vacuoles, and nuclei

## The Fluorescence Microscope
- Shows a bright image of the object resulting from fluorescent light emitted by the specimen
- Produces image by exciting a speciment with a wavelength of light that triggers the object to emit fluorescence light
- Microbe is stained by fluorochromes that absorb light and emit visible fluorescent light
- Essential tool in microbiology
	- Fluorochrome-labeled probes
		- Antibodies (detects specific antigen)
		- Fluorochrome dyes tag specific cell constituents for identification of unknown pathogens
		- Localization of specific proteins in cells

## Confocal Microscopy
- Uses a laser beam to illuminate a fluorescently labeled specimen
- Confocal scanning laser microscopy creates sharp, composite 3D image of specimens by using an aperture that eliminates stray light outside of the plane of focus
- Numerous applications including study of biofilms

- Sharper image using the monochromatic light, unlike light microscopes that use broad-spectrum light source (halogen or LED)

_What is the maximum theoretical resolving power when viewing a specimen when an oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.25 and blue/green light?_

$d = \frac{0.5(500 nm)}{2(1.25)} = 200 nm$
