# 2.1 - Lenses Create Images by Bending Light

---

**Refractive index** - A measure of how much a substance deflects a light ray from a straight path as it passes from one medium to another
- Calculated as the ratio of the velocity of light passing through the first medium to that of light passing through the second medium

- Light microscopes were the first microscopes invented
- Microscopes accurately enlarge, or magnify, the image of an object
- The refractive index is a measure of how much a substance slows the velocity of light
- The direction and magnitude of bending are determines by the refractive indices of the two media forming the interface
- From air into glass, which has a greater refractive index, it is slowed and bent toward the normal

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523182234.png)

- Lenses act like a collection of prisms operating as a unit

**Focal point $(F)$** - where light rays converge (convex lenses) or diverge in (concave lenses)
**Focal length $(f)$** - the distance between the center of the lens and the focal point

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523182525.png)

- Eyes cannot focus on objects nearer thatn 25 cm
- Lens strength is related to focal length
- A lens with a short focal length magnifies an object more

# 2.2 - There Are Several Types of Light Microscopes

---

- Modern microscopes are compound, they have two sets of lenses
- The objective lens is the lenses closest to the specimen

## Bright-Field Microscope: Dark Object, Bright 

**Bright-field microscope** - a microscope that illuminates the specimen directly with bright light and forms a dark image on a brighter background

- Used for stained and unstained specimens

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523182802.png)

- The substage condenser lens is beneath the stage and focuses a cone of light on the slide

**Parfocal** - a microscope that retains proper focus when the objectives are changed

## Better Microscope Resolution Means a Clearer Image

**Resolution** - the ability of a microscope to distinguish between small objects that are close together

- The resolution of a bright-field microscope is 0.2 µm
	- Same as a small bacterium

**Numerical aperture ($n sin \theta$)** - the property of a microscope lens that determines how much light can enter and how great a resolution the lens can provide

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523183615.png)

- Numerical aperture is dependent on refractive index ($n$) of medium in which the lens works and angle $\theta$, which is $1/2$ the angle of the cone of light entering on emanating lens
- Refractive index of air is 1
- Objective lenses work in air, since $sin\theta$ cannot be greater than 1
- Therefore, no lens in air can have a numerical aperture greater than 1
- To increase the $n$, use immersion oil, which has the same refractive index as glass
- Light rays enter the objective lens that would have escaped due to reflection and refraction at the surface of the lenses and slide

Ernst Abbe (1840 - 1905)
- Mathematical representation of resolution

$d$ - minimal distance
$\lambda$ - wavelength of light
$n sin\theta$ - numerical aperture

$d = \frac{0.5\lambda}{nsin\theta}$

- The smaller the d, the better the resolution
- The greatest resolution is obtain using a lens with the largest possible numerical aperture and light of the shortest wavelength (blue; 450 to 500 nm)


- The condenser is a large, light gathering lens used to project a wide cone of light through the slide and into the objective lens
	- Most have a $n$ between 1.2 and 1.4, although will not exceed 0.9 unless oiled

$d_{microscope} = \frac{\lambda}{NA_{objective} + NA_{condenser}}$

Example:
- Using oil immersion (NA = 1.25)
- Green light = 0.2 µm

$d_{microscope} = \frac{\lambda}{NA_{objective}}$

$d_{microscope} = \frac{(0.5)(530 nm)}{1.25}=212 nm = 0.2 \micro m$


## Visualizing Living, Unstained Microbes

- Microbes are un-pigmented are not clearly visible
- Staining procedures usually kill cells

### Dark-Field Microscope: Bright Object, Dark Background

**Dark-field microscopy** - Microscopy in which the specimen is brightly illuminated while the background is dark

- Produced detailed images of living, unstained cells and organisms by changing the illumination
- Hollow cone is focused on the specimen that unreflected and unperfected rays do not enter the objective
- Reveals internal structure in larger eukaryotic microorganosms
- Identify bacteria such as thin _Treponema pallidum_, the causative agent of syphilis

### Phase-Contrast Microscope

**Phase-contrast microscope** - A microscope that converts slight differences in refractive index and cell density into easily observed differences in light intensity

- Light passing through cell structure will be diffracted slower than outside the cell
- Deviated and undeviated light waves create a phase shift that form an image
- A condenser annulus and phase plate focus the deviated light on the plate, which lets it pass through and changes the wavelength
- When light recombines it causes destructive interference resulting in an image of a darker bacterium against a lighter background

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523185447.png)

- Used for microbial motility, determining the shape of living cells, and detecting bacterial structures such as endospores and inclusions
- They have refractive indices different from water
- Used in eukaryotic cells

### Differential Interference Constrast Microscope

**Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope** - a light microscope that employs two beams of plane polarized light
- The beams are combined after passing through the specimen and their interference is used to create the image

- Also creates an image by detecting differences in refractive indices and thickness
- A live, unstained specimen appears brightly colours, giving a 3-dimensional image
- Structures such as cell walls, endospores, granules, vacuoles, and nuclei are visible

## Fluorescence Microscope Use Emitted Light to Create Images

**Fluorescent light** - the light emitted by a substance when it is irradiated with light of shorter wavelength

**Fluorscence microscope** - a microscope that exposes a specimen to light of a specific wavelength and then forms an image from the fluorescent light produced

- When some molecules absorb radiant energy, they become excited and release their trapped energy as light
- Light emitted has a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the radiation originally absorbed
- Most common fluoresence microscopy is epifluorescence, also called incident light or reflected light microscopry
- Illuminates specimens from above
- A mercury vapour arc lamp produce a light beam that passes through an exiter filter that transmits the desired wavelength
- Light is reflected by a dichromatic mirror, which passes the shorter wavelength (excitation light)
- The fluorochrome absorbs the light energy and emits visible fluorescent light

**Fluorochrome** - A fluorescent dye

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523190318.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523190350.png)

- Bacterial pathogens can be identified after staining with fluorochromes or tagging
- Fluorescence microscopy is used of the localization of specific proteins within cells
- Genetic engineering techniques that fuse the gene for the protein of interest to a gene isolated from jellyfish
- Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is used on bacterial cell division

## Confocal Microscopy

**Confocal microscope** - a light microscope in which monochromatic laser-derived light scans across the specimen at a specific level
 - Stray light from above and below the plane of focus is blocked out to give an image with excellent contrast and resolution

- 3-dimensional objects are viewed with traditional light microscopes
- from all three planes
- The resulting image is murky and fuzzy
- Confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM) uses a laser beam to illuminated a fluorescently stained specimen
- A aperture is placed above the objective lens which eliminated stray light from the specimen

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523190915.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523190932.png)

- A computer interfaced with the confocal microscope receives digitized information from each plane to create a detailed composite image
- Used in biofilms, that are on indwelling medial devices such as hip joint replacements
