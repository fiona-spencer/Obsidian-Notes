# 2.1 - Lenses Create Images by Bending Light

---

**Refractive index** - A measure of how much a substance deflects a light ray from a straight path as it passes from one medium to another
- Calculated as the ratio of the velocity of light passing through the first medium to that of light passing through the second medium


# 2.2 - There Are Several Types of Light Microscopes


---
## Bright-Field Microscope: Dark Object, Bright 

**Bright-field microscope** - a microscope that illuminates the specimen directly with bright light and forms a dark image on a brighter background

**Parfocal** - a microscope that retains proper focus when the objectives are changed

## Better Microscope Resolution Means a Clearer Image

**Resolution** - the ability of a microscope to distinguish between small objects that are close together


**Numerical aperture** - the property of a microscope lens that determines how much light can enter and how great a resolution the lens can provide


## Visualizing Living, Unstained Microbes
### Dark-Field Microscope: Bright Object, Dark Background

**Dark-field microscopy** - Microscopy in which the specimen is brightly illuminated while the background is dark

### Phase-Contrast Microscope

**Phase-contrast microscope** - A microscope that converts slight differences in refractive index and cell density into easily observed differences in light intensity


### Differential Interference Constrast Microscope

**Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope** - a light microscope that employs two beams of plane polarized light
- The beams are combined after passing through the specimen and their interference is used to create the image


## Fluorescence Microscope Use Emitted Light to Create Images

**Fluorescent light** - the light emitted by a substance when it is irradiated with light of shorter wavelength

**Fluorscence microscope** - a microscope that exposes a specimen to light of a specific wavelength and then forms an image from the fluorescent light produced

**Fluorochrome** - A fluorescent dye


## Confocal Microscopy

**Confocal microscope** - a light microscope in which monochromatic laser-derived light scans across the specimen at a specific level
 - Stray light from above and below the plane of focus is blocked out to give an image with excellent contrast and resolution

# 2.3 - Staining Helps to Visualize and Identify Microbes

## Fixation

**Fixation** - The process in which the internal and external structures of cells and organisms are preserved an fixed in position
- The conversion of inorganic, gaseous elements such as carbon (CO_2) and nitrogen (N_2) to organic forms

**Heat fixation** - The process in which the inter

**Chemical fixation**
## Dyes and Simple Staining

**Chromophore group** - a chemical group with double bonds that absorb visible light and gives a dye its colour

**Negative staining** - a staining procedure in which a dye is used to make the background dark while the specimen is unstained

## Differential Staining

**Differential staining** - staining procedures that divide bacteria into groups based on staining properties

**Acid-fast staining** - a staining procedure that differentiates between bacteria based on their ability to retain a dye when washed with an acid alcohol solution

**Flagellum** - a threadlike appendage on many cells that is responsible for motiility
- Bacterial flagella are composed of basal body at the base of the flagellum, which attaches it to the cell, and hook, which connects the basal body to the filament
- The filament is the part of the flagellum that rotates and moves the bacterium

# 2.4 - Electron Microscopes Use Beams of Electrons to Create Highly Magnified Images 

---


## Transmission Electron Microscope

**Transmission electron microscope (TEM)** - a microscope in which an image is formed by passing an electron beam through a specimen and focusing the scattered electrons with magnetic lenses
## Scanning Electron Microscope

**Scanning electron microscope (SEM)** - an electron microscope that passes a beam of electrons over the surface of a specimen; an image is formed from the electrons that are emitted by the specimen


## Cryo-Electron Microscopy

**Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)** - a specialized electron microscopy procedure that involved rapid freezing of intact specimens, examining the specimen in a frozen state, and imaging from different angles
- The information from each angle is used to create a three-dimensional reconstruction

# 2.5 - Scanning Probe Microscopy Can Visualize Molecules and Atoms

---

**Scanning probe microscopes (SPMs)** - a microscope used to study surface features by moving a sharp probe over the object's surface
- Atomic force and scanning tunneling microscope

**Scanning tunneling microscope** - A microscope used to study surface features by moving a sharp probe over the object's surface
