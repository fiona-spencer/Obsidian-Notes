# 2.1 - Lenses Create Images by Bending Light

---

**Refractive index** - A measure of how much a substance deflects a light ray from a straight path as it passes from one medium to another
- Calculated as the ratio of the velocity of light passing through the first medium to that of light passing through the second medium


# 2.2 - There Are Several Types of Light Microscopes


---
## Bright-Field Microscope: Dark Object, Bright 

**Bright-field microscope** - a microscope that illuminates the specimen directly with bright light and forms a dark image on a brighter background

**Parfocal** - a microscope that retains proper focus when the objectives are changed

## Better Microscope Resolution Means a Clearer Image

**Resolution** - the ability of a microscope to distinguish between small objects that are close together


**Numerical aperture** - the property of a microscope lens that determines how much light can enter and how great a resolution the lens can provide


## Visualizing Living, Unstained Microbes
### Dark-Field Microscope: Bright Object, Dark Background

**Dark-field microscopy** - Microscopy in which the specimen is brightly illuminated while the background is dark

### Phase-Contrast Microscope

**Phase-contrast microscope** - A microscope that converts slight differences in refractive index and cell density into easily observed differences in light intensity


### Differential Interference Constrast Microscope

**Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope** - a light microscope that employs two beams of plane polarized light
- The beams are combined after passing through the specimen and their interference is used to create the image


## Fluorescence Microscope Use Emitted Light to Create Images

**Fluorescent light** - the light emitted by a substance when it is irradiated with light of shorter wavelength

**Fluorscence microscope** - a microscope that exposes a specimen to light of a specific wavelength and then forms an image from the fluorescent light produced

**Fluorochrome** - A fluorescent dye


## Confocal Microscopy

**Confocal microscope** - a light microscope in which monochromatic laser-derived light scans across the specimen at a specific level
 - Stray light from above and below the plane of focus is blocked out to give an image with excellent contrast and resolution
