# 1.1 - Members of Microbial World

---
**Microorganisms** - An organisms that is usually too small to be seen clearly with the naked eye and is often unicellular, or if multicellular, does not exhibit a high degree of differentiation

- The majority of bacteria and archaea live in oceans and sediments, either within the Earth's crust or deep below the crust (subsurface)
- About $10^{30}$ microbes on Earth
- Microbes are generally 1 mm or less in diameter


![](Pasted%20image%2020250507115158.png)

- A variety of acellular biological entities, including viruses and sub-viral agents, are also called _microorganisms_ and _microbes_
	- These agents cannot reproduced independently; not alive
- Cells exhibited one of two possible "floor plans"

2 Floor Plans
1) Prokaryotic cells (_pro_, _karyon_; "kernel")
	- Open floor plant
	- Contents are not divided into compartments by membranes
2) Eukaryotic cells (_eu_; "true")
	- Have a nucleus and other membrane bound organelles

5 Kingdoms
1. Monera
2. Protista
3. Fungi
4. Animalia
5. Plantae

_*Microorganisms were places in the first 3 kingdoms_
_*The 5 kingdom system is no longer accepted since prokaryotes are too diverse_
_*Prokaryotes were places in the Monera kingdom_

3 Progressions in Microbe Classification
1) Development of electron microscopy
	- Revealed detailed structure of microbial cells
2) Methods that measure the biochemical and physiological characteristics
	- Different microorganisms demonstrate similarities and differences
3) Genomic revolution
	- Enables the analysis of nucleic acid and protein sequences

- ==Carl Woese== (1928 - 2012) in the 1970s, began the comparison of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) nucleic acid sequences which helped the understanding of _prokaryotes_
- Two different groups of organisms with prokaryotic cell morphology
	- Bacteria and Archaea
- Protists wat not a cohesive unit, and was divided into three or more kingdoms
	1. Bacteria
	2. Archaea
	3. Eukarya

# 1.2 - Microbes Have Evolved and Diversified for Billions of Years

---

## Theories of the Origin of Life Depend Primarily on Indirect Evidence
- Earth is ~4.5 to 4.6 billion years old

**Extant organism** - An organism that exists on Earth today

- Some extant organisms have structures and molecules that represent ancient life forms

### Fossil Record
- Life was present on Earth ~3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago
- Chemicals found in rock or sediment that are chemically related to biological molecules
- Hopanes in a rock indicate that bacteria were present when the rock was formed
	- Hopanes are formed from hopanoids, which are found in the plasma membranes of extant bacteria


![](Pasted%20image%2020250507123346.png)


## Early Life Was Probably RNA-based
- Evidence suggest that Earth was a hot and anoxic, with an atmosphere rich in water vapour, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen
- In the oceans, hydrogen, methane, and carboxylic acids were formed by geological and chemical processes
- Areas near hydrothermal vest generated molecules that functioned as catalysts, and formed the predecessors of modern cell structures


#### Hydrothermal Vents: Did Life Begin Under the Sea?
- Origin of life needed energy to synthesize biomolecules

3 Hypotheses of the Origin of Biomolecules:

1)  _Panspermia theory_ suggests that meteorites brought biomolecules
2) _Primordial soup theory_ suggests that organic molecules were spontaneously assembled by an input of energy, such as lighting
3) _Hydrothermal vent theory_ suggests that both the energy and the molecules in hydrothermal vents contributed

- Hydrothermal vents are geo-thermally active deep-sea chasms below the surface of the ocean
- Vents pump 400°C sulfide rich water into cold ambient water, causing the sulfide to instantly precipitate
- Other vent systems that are alkaline causes calcium carbonate precipitates, forming white chimneys (around 45-90°C and alkaline; pH 9-11)
- A study in 2019 shows that a mixture of molecules called single-chain amphiphiles (SCAs), which are simpler version of more familiar phospholipids, can from vesicles in hot, alkaline pH seawater
- Therefore, 3.7 to 4.0 bya the presence of pH gradient across geological barriers drove the formation of random organic molecules, some of which were SCAs
- The SCAs accumulated and formed vesicles that entrapped fluids preserving the pH gradient

- Early cells, called _probionts_
- In modern cells, 3 different molecules makeup catalysts, structural, and hereditary molecules

1) Proteins
	- Structural
	- Catalytic
2) DNA
	- Hereditary
3) RNA
	- Synthesis

**Enzymes** - A protein catalyst with specificity for the reaction catalyzed and its substrates

- ==Thomas Cech== discovered an RNA molecules in a protist (_Tetrahymena sp._) that also had catalytic activity
- Other catalytic RNA molecules such as RNA found in ribosomes that form peptide bonds (bonds that hold amino acids)

**Ribozyme** - An RNA molecule with catalytic activity

- Ribozymes suggests that RNA was capable of storing, copying, and expressing genetic information, as well as catalyzing other chemical reaction
- ==Walter Gilbert== coined the term **RNA world** to describe this pre-cellular stage in the evolution of life

**RNA World** - The theory that posits that the first self-replicating molecule was RNA and this led to the evolution of the first primitive cell

- For the pre-cellular RNA stage to evolve, a lipid membrane must have formed
- Lipids, spontaneously form liposomes (vesicles bounded by a lipid bilayer)


![](Pasted%20image%2020250507125458.png)


- The cellular pool of RNA in modern cells exists in the ribosome, a structure that consists largely of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and uses messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) to construct proteins
- rRNA catalyzes peptide bond formation during protein synthesis
- RNA could have given rise to double-stranded DNA
	- Once DNA evolved, it became the storage facility of genetic information because it provided a more chemically stable structure
- 2 evidence to support RNA world hypothesis
	- Energy currency of cells, ATP, is a ribonucleotide
	- Discovery that RNA can regulate gene expression

RNA World Hypothesis Skepticism
- Other experiments suggest the first nucleic acids may have been a mix of DNA and RNA
- Early Earth lack oxygen, thus cells arose must have been able to handle harsh conditions
- Heat-loving archaea may be the remnant of the first form of energy metabolism
- Oxygen-releasing photosynthesis appears to evolved 2.7 bya
- Stromatolites are layered rocks formed by the incorporation of mineral sediments into layers of cyanobacteria growing in thick mats on surfaces
- The oxygen released by cyanobacteria is thought to have alerted Earth's atmosphere and oxygen-rich state, allowing the evolution of additional energy-capturing strategies such as aerobic respiration (use by animals and many microbes)

### Evolution of the 3 Domains of Life

**Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)** - The most recent organism to which all extant organisms are related

- LUCA is on the bacterial branch
	- Archaea and Eukarya evolved independently, separate from Bacteria
- Archaea and Eukarya shared common ancestry, but diverged and became separate domains
- Recent evidence supports that Eukarya evolved from Archaea

**Universal Phylogenetic tree** - A phylogenetic tree that considers the evolutionary relationship among organisms from all three domains of life

- Certain protein subunits of archaeal and eukaryotic RNA polymerases, the enzymes that catalyze RNA synthesis, resemble each other to the exclusion of those of bacteria
- However, archaea and bacteria has similar mechanisms for conserving energy

### Mitochondria, Mitochondria-Like Organelles, and Chloroplasts Evolved from Endosymbionts

**Endosymbiotic hypothesis** - The hypothesis that mitochondria, and related organelles (e.g. hydrogenosomes), and chloroplasts arose from bacterial endosymbionts of ancestral eukaryotic cells
- Origin of eukaryotic organelles
	- Microchondria
	- Chloroplansts
	- Hydrogenosomes

**Endosymbiosis** - A type of symbiosis in which one organism is found within another organism

![](Pasted%20image%2020250517134726.png)

- If the intracellular bacterium used aerobic respiration, it became a mitochondrion
- If the endosymbiont was a cyanobacterium and performed photosynthesis, it became a chloroplast

- Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes, both similar to bacterial DNA and ribosomes
- Peptidoglycan has been found between the two membranes that enclose the chloroplasts of some algae
- Proteobacteria => mitochondria
- Cyanobacteria => chloroplasts

**Hydrogen hypothesis** - A hypothesis that considers the origin of the eukaryotes through the development of the hydrogenosomes
- Suggests the organelle arose as the result of an endosymbiotic anaerobic bacterium that produced $CO_2$ and $H_2$ as the products of fermentation
- Hydrogenosomes is found in some extant protists that produce ATP by fermentation


### Evolution of Cellular Microbes
- Mutations that allowed the organisms to increase its rate of reproduction or survival were selected and passed on to subsequent generations
- Selective forces, geographic isolation of populations allowed some groups to evolve separately from others
- Most eukaryotic species increase their genetic diversity by reproducing sexually
- Bacteria and archaea do not reproduce sexually
	- They increase genetic diversity by mutation and horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
- In HGT, genetic information from a donor organisms is transferred to a recipient, creating a new genotype


**Phyletic classification system** - A classification system based on evolutionary relationships, rather than the general similarity of characteristics

**Phylogeny** - The evolutionary development of a species

- Microbial phylogeny relies on comparisons of multiple features in extant organisms
	- Cell wall structure
	- Fatty acids
	- Housekeeping proteins
	- Nucleotide sequences
	- Subunit rRNA molecules (SSU rRNA)


![](Pasted%20image%2020250517140200.png)


## Phylogenetic Trees

**Phylogenetic tree** - a graph made of nodes and branches, much like a tree in shape, that shows phylogenetic relationships between groups or organisms and sometimes also indicates the evolutionary development of groups

- Amino acids are often compared because nucleotide changes may not alter the resulting protein and therefore have little or no impact on evolution
- rRNA from small ribosomal subunits were the molecule of choice
	- 16S from bacteria
	- 18S from eukaryotes
- SSU rRNAs are necessary in all microorganisms
- Neither housekeeping proteins or SSU rRNA tolerate large changes in sequences
- The variable regions in SSU rRNA enable comparison between closely related microbes, whereas the stable sequences allow the comparison of more distantly related microorganisms
- Comparative analysis of SSU rRNA sequences demonstrated the presence of oligonucleotide signature sequence

**Oligonucleotide signature sequence** - Short, conserved nucleotide sequence that are specific for a phylogenetic defined group of organisms
- The signature sequences found in small subunit rRNA molecules are most commonly used

2 Approaches of Building a Phylogenetic Tree
1) Distance-based
2) Character-based

- The tip of each branch in the tree (node) represents one of the organisms used in the comparison
- The distance from one node to another is the evolutionary distance between the two organisms

![](Pasted%20image%2020250517141308.png)

Distance-Method
- One algorithm called cluster analysis serially links pairs that are more distantly related
- Neighbour joining is another distance-based method that uses a different matrix to modify the distance between each pair of nodes based on the average divergence from all other nodes

Character-Method
- Character-based approaches for phylogenetic tree building are more complicated, but generate more robust trees
- Sometimes called tree-searching, these methods include maximum parsimony, which assumes that the fewest number of changes occurred between ancestor and extant organisms

- Another approach is maximum likelihood
- For each possible tree, its probability based on certain evolutionary and molecular information is determined so that the tree with the greatest probability based on these criteria is selected

- Bayesian inference is another character-based approach
- Analyzes multiple potential trees and calculates the probability that each branch would appear based on this comparison
