# 1.1 - Members of Microbial World

---
**Microorganisms** - An organisms that is usually too small to be seen clearly with the naked eye and is often unicellular, or if multicellular, does not exhibit a high degree of differentiation

- The majority of bacteria and archaea live in oceans and sediments, either within the Earth's crust or deep below the crust (subsurface)

- A variety of acellular biological entities, including viruses and sub-viral agents, are also called _microorganisms_ and _microbes_
- These agents cannot reproduced independently; not alive
- Cells exhibited one of two possible "floor plans"

2 Floor Plans
1) Prokaryotic cells (_pro_, _karyon_; "kernel")
	- Open floor plant
	- Contents are not divided into compartments by membranes
2) Eukaryotic cells (_eu_; "true")
	- Have a nucleus and other membrane bound organelles

5 Kingdoms
1. Monera
2. Protista
3. Fungi
4. Animalia
5. Plantae

_*Microorganisms were places in the first 3 kingdoms_
_*The 5 kingdom system is no longer accepted since prokaryotes are too diverse_

3 Progressions in Microbe Classification
1) Development of electron microscopy
	- Revealed detailed structure of microbial cells
2) Methods that measure the biochemical and physiological characteristics
	- Different microorganisms demonstrate similarities and differences
3) Genomic revolution
	- Enables the analysis of nucleic acid and protein sequences

- Carl Woese (1928 - 2012) in the 1970s, began the comparison of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) nucleic acid sequences which helped the understanding of _prokaryotes_
- Two different groups of organisms with prokaryotic cell morphology
	- Bacteria and Archaea
- Protists wat not a cohesive unit, and was divided into three or more kingdoms
	1. Bacteria
	2. Archaea
	3. Eukarya

## Bacteria
- Usually single-celled organisms
- Most have walls that contain peptidoglycan
- Most do not cause disease
- Forms the human microbiome
- Disease
	- Black Death

**Microbiome** - The totality of microorganisms and microbial genomes that constitute a host's normal microbiota

## Archaea
- Distinctive rRNA sequence, cell walls, and membrane lipids
- Unique metabolic characteristics
	- Generate methane gas
- Extremophiles
- No not directly cause disease in humans

## Eukarya
- Plants
- Animals
- Microorganisms (Protists, Fungi)


**Protists** - Unicellular and sometimes colonial eukaryotic organisms that lack cellular differentiation into tissues
- Many chemo-oganotrophic protists are referred to as protozoa
- Many phototrophic protists are referred to as algae

**Protozoa** - A common term for a group of unrelated unicellular, chemo-organotrophic protists

**Fungi** - Achlorophyllous, heterophic, spore-bearing eukaryote with absorptive nutrition and a walled thallus
- Unicellular forms
	- Yeasts
- Multicellular
	- Molds
	- Mushrooms
- Metabolic capabilities
	- Dough rise
	- Producing antibiotics
	- Decomposing dead organisms
- Fungi associate with plant roots to form mycorrhizae
- Mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients to the roots
- Other fungi cause plant disease
	- Plants
		- Rusts
		- Powdery milders
		- Smuts
	- Humans

**Viruses** - An infectious agent having a simple acellular organization with a protein coat and a nucleic acid genome, lacking independent metabolism, and multiplying only within living host cells
- Virions are virus particles, composed of proteins, and nucleic acid
- Viral diseases
	- Rabies
	- Influenza
	- AID
	- Common cold
	- Some cancers
- Viruses are critical in shaping microbial communities in aquatic environments

**Viroids** - An infectious agent that is a single-stranded RNA not associated with any protein, the RNA does not code for any proteins and is not translated

**Satellites** - Subviral infectious agents composed of DNA or RNA encapsulated with the aid of an unrelated helper virus
- Must coinfect a host cell with a virus to complete their life cycle

**Prions** - An infectious agent consisting only of protein, prions cause a variety of spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie in sheep



# 1.2 - Microbes Have Evolved and Diversified for Billions of Years

---

## Theories of the Origin of Life Depend Primarily on Indirect Evidence
- Earth is ~4.5 to 4.6 billion years old

**Extant organism** - An organism that exists on Earth today

- Some extant organisms have structures and molecules that represent ancient life forms

### Fossil Record
- Life was present on Earth ~3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago
- Chemicals found in rock or sediment that are chemically related to biological molecules
- Hopanes in a rock indicate that bacteria were present when the rock was formed
	- Hopan














# 1.3 - Microbiology Advanced as New Tools for Studying Microbes  Developed
# 1.4 Microbiology Encompasses Many Subdisciplines
