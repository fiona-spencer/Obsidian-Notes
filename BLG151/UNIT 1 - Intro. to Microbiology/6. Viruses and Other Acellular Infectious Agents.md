# 6.1 - Viruses Are Acellular

---

**Virology** - the branch of microbiology that is concerned with viruses and viral diseases

**Virus** - an infectious agent having a simple a acellular organization with a protein coat and a nucleic acid genome, lacking independent metabolism, and multiplying only within living host cells


**Bacteriopage/phage** - a virus that uses bacteria as its host, often called a phage


# 6.2 - Virion Structure Is Defines by Capsid Symmetry and Presence or Absence of an Envelope

---
**Virion** - a compete virus particle; at the simplest, it consists of a protein capsid surrounding a single nucleic acid molecule


## General Structural Properties

**Nucleocapsid** - the viral nucleic acid and its surrounding capsid; the basic unit of virion structure

**Capsid** - the protein coat or shell that surrounds a virion's nucleic acid

**Enveloped virus** - a virus having virions with a nucleocapsid enclosed within a lipid bilayer

**Non-enveloped (naked) virus** - a virus having virions composed only of a nucleocapsid (lacking an envelope)

**Promoter** - an individual protein of a viral capsid, a capsomer is made of promoters

### Helical Capsids

**Helical capsid** - a viral capsid in the form of a helix


### Icosahedral Capsids

**Icosahedra capsid** - a viral capsid that has the shape of a regular polyhedron having 20 equilateral triangular faces and 12 corners

**Capsomer** - the ring-shaped morphological unit of icosahedral capsids



### Capsids of Complex Symmetry

**Binal symmetry** - the symmetry of some virus capsid (e.g., those of complex phages) that is a combination of icosahedral and helical symmetry



## Viral Envelopes and Enzymes

**Envelope** -  in virology, an outer membraneous layer that surrounds the nucleocapsid of some viruses

**Spikes/peplomer (spike)** - a protein or protein complex that extends from the viral envelope and often is important in virion attachment to the host-cell surface

## Viral Genomes are Structurally Diverse

**Segmented genome** - a viral genome that is divided into several parts or fragments, each usually coding for a single polypeptide



# 6.3 - Viral Life Cycles Have Five Steps

---

### Attachment (Adsorption)

**Receptors** - proteins that bind signalling molecules (ligands), thereby initiating cellular responses

**Tropism** - the movement of living organisms towards or away from a focus of heat, light or other stimulus
- The selective infection of certain organisms or host tissues by a virus due to the presence of the specific receptor to which the viral binds


### Entry into the Host
### Synthesis
### Assembly
### Virion Release
# 6.4 - There Are Several Types of Viral Infections

---
### Lytic and Lysogenic Infections Are Common for Bacterial and Archaeal Cells

**Virulent (bacteriophages) viruses** - viruses that lyse their host cells at the end of the viral life cycle 

**Temperate bacteriophages (viruses)** - bacterial and archaeal viruses that can establish a lysogenic relationship, rather than immediately lysing their hosts

**Lysogeny** - the state in which a viral genome remains within a bacterial or archaeal cell after infection and reproduced along with it, rather than taking control of the host cell and destroying it

**Phophage** - the latent from of a temperate bacterial or archaeal virus that remain within the lysogen, usually integrated into the host chromosome
- The form of a eukaryotic virus that remains within the host cell during a latent infection
- Also refers to the retroviral genome after it has been integrates into the host's chromosome

**Lysogens/lysogenic bacteria** - bacterial and archaeal cells that carry a provirus and can produce viruses under the proper conditions

**Induction** - in virology, the events that trigger a virus to switch from a lysogenic mode to a lytic pathway
- In genetics, an increase in gene expression


**Lysogenic cycle** - the phase of a template virus's life cycle in which it establishes and maintains lysogeny

**Lytic cycle** - a viral life cycle that results in the lysis of the host cell

**Lysogenic conversion** - a change in the phenotype of bacterium due to the presence of a prophage




### Infections of Eukaryotic Cells


**Cytopathic effect** - the observable change that occurs in cells as a result of viral replication

# 6.5 - Virus Cultivation and Enumeration

---

**Plaque** - a clear area in a lawn of host cells that result from their lysis by viruses

**Plaque assay** - a method used to determine the number of infectious virions

**Plaque-forming unit (PFU)** - the unit of measure of a plaque assay
 - Usually represents a single infectious virion



# 6.6 - Viroids and Satellites: Nucleic Acid-Based Subviral Agents

---

**Viroid** - an infectious agent that is a single-stranded RNA not associated with any protein; the RNA does not code for any proteins and is not translated

**RNA silencing** - a response made by eukaryotic cells that protects them from infections caused by double-stranded RNA viruses

**Satellites** - subviral infectious agents composed of DNA or RNA encapsidated with the aid of an unrelated helper virus

# 6.7 - Prions Are Composed Only of Protein

---

**Prion** - an infectious agent consisting only of protein; prion cause a variety of spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie in sheep
