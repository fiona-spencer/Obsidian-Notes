# 5.1 - Eukaryotic Cells Are Diverse but Share Some Common Features

---
## Shape and Size
## Cell Organization

**Organelle** - a structure within or on a cell performs specific functions and is related to the cell in a way similar to that of an organ to the body of a multicellular organism


# 5.2 - Eukaryotic Cell Envelopes

---

**Glycocalyx** - a network of polysaccharides extending from the surface of bacteria and other cells

# 5.3 - The Eukaryotic Cytoplasm Contains a Cytoskeleton and Organelles

---

**Cytoplasm** - all material in the cell enclosed by the plasma membrane, with the exception of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells

**Cytosol** - liquid component of the cytoplasm

**Cytoskeleton** - a network of structures made from filamentous proteins (e.g., actin and tubulin) and other components in the cytoplasm of cells

**Actin filaments** - one of the proteinaceous components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton; also called microfilaments

**Microtubules** - one of the proteinaceous components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, flagella, and cilia; composed of tubulin proteins




# 5.4 - Several Organelles Function in the Secretory and Endocytic Pathways

---
## Endoplasmic Reticulum

**Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** - a system of membranous tubules and flattened sacs (cisternae) in eukaryotic cells
- Rough endoplamic reticulum (RER) bears ribosomes on its surface
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) lacks them



## The Golgi Apparatus Prepares Materials for Secretion

**Golgi apparatus** - a membranous eukaryotic organelle composed of stacks (dictyosomes) of flattened sacs (cisternae) involved in packaging and modifying materials for secretion and many other processes

## Lysosomes Are Degradative Organelles that Function in Endocytic Pathways

**Lysosome** - a spherical membraneous eukaryotic organelle that contain hydrolytic enzymes and is responsible for the intracellular digestion of substance


## Transport and Secretory Pathways Move Molecules to Other Locations, Including Outside the Cell

**Secretory pathway** - the process used by eukaryotic cells to synthesize proteins and lipids, followed by secretion or delivery to organelles or the plasma membrane

**Proteasome** - a large, cylindrical protein complex observed in eukaryotic cells that degrades ubiquitin-labeled proteins to peptides in an ATP-dependent process
- Also called 26S proteasome
- Similar protein-degrading machinery has been observed in some archaea and bacteria

## There Are Several Endocytic Pathways

**Endocytosis** - the process in which a cell takes up solutes or particles by enclosing them in vesicles pinched off from its plasma membrane
- It often occurs at regions of the plasma membrane coated by proteins such as clathrin and caveolin
- Endocytosis involving these proteins is called clathrin-dependent endocytosis and caveolin-dependent endocytosis, respectively
- When the substance endocytosed first binds to a receptor, the process is called receptor-mediated endocytosis


**Ligand** - proteins that bind signalling molecules (ligands), thereby initiating cellular responses

**Receptors** - proteins that bind signalling molecules (ligands), thereby initiating cellular responses

**Phagosome** - a membrane-enclosed vacuole formed by the invagination of the cell membrane during endocytosis


**Clathrin-dependent endocytosis** - the

**Caveolin-dependent endocytosis**

**Endosome** - a membraneous vesicle formed by endocytosis
- It undergoes a maturational process that starts with early endosomes and proceeds to late endosomes and finally lysosomes


**Autophagy** - ancient means of-homeostasis whereby intracellular-components are recycled


**Macro-autophagy** - digestion of cytoplasmic components that involved enclosing the material (e.g., an organelle) in a double-membrane structure called a autophagosome
- The autophagosome deliver the material to a lysosome for digestion


**Residual body** - a lysosome after digestion of its contents has occurs
- It contains undigested material


## Extracellular Vesicles

**Extracellular vesicles (EVs)** - small vesicle with a lipid bilayer that form by pinching off a portion of a cell membrane
- These contain a sample of the cytoplasm or periplasm


# 5.5 - The Nucleus and Ribosomes are Involved in Genetic Control of the Cell

---
## Nucleus

**Nucleus** - the eukaryotic organelle enclosed by a double-membrane envelope that contain the cell's chromosomes

**Chromosomes** - the bodies that have most or all the cell's DNA and contain most of its genetic information (mitochondria and chloroplast also contain DNA)

**Chromatin** - the complex of DNA and proteins, including histones, from which eukaryotic and some archaeal chromosomes are made

**Nucleosome** - a complex of histones and DNA found in eukaryotic chromatin and some archaea; the DNA is wrapped around the surface of the histone complex

**Nuclear envelope** - the complex double-membrane structure forming the outer boundary of the eukaryotic nucleus
- It is covered by nuclear pores through which substances enter and leave the nucleus


**Nuclear pore complex** - the nuclear pore plus about 30 proteins that form the pore and are involved in moving materials across the nuclear envelope

**Nuceolus** - the organelle, located within the nucleus and not bounded by a membrane, that is the location of ribosomal RNA synthesis and the assembly of ribosomal subunits






## Eukaryotic Ribosomes Are Larger and Contain Different Molecules than Bacterial and Archaeal Ribosomes

# 5.6 - Mitochondria, Related Organelles, and Chloroplasts are Involved in Energy Conservation

---

**Mitochondria** (s., mitochondrion) - the eukaryotic organeel that is the site of electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and pathways such as the Krebs cycle
- Provides most of non-photosynthetic cell's energy under aerobic conditions



## The Aerobic Mitochondrion Belongs to the Family of Mitochondrial-Related Organelles

**Cristae** (s., crista) - infoldings of the inner mitochondrial membrane

**Hydrogenosomes** - one membrane of the mitochondrial family of organelles, its is found in some anaerobic protists that produce ATP by fermentation


## Chloroplasts

**Plastid** - a cytoplasmic organelle of algae and higher plants that contains pigments such as chlorophyll, stores food reserves, and often carries out processes such as photosynthesis

**Chloroplast** - a eukaryotic plastid that contains chlorophyll and is the site of photosynthesis

**Thylakoid** - a flattened sac in the chloroplast stroma that contain photosynthetic pigments and the photosynthetic electron transport chain
- Similar structures are observed in the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria


# 5.7 - Many Eukaryotic Microbes Have External Structures Used for Motility

---

**Cilia** (s., cilium) - threadlike appendages extending from the surface of some protists that beat rhythmically to propel them
- Cilia are membrane-bound cylinders with a complex internal array of microtubules, usually in a 9 + 2 pattern

**Flagella** (s., flagellum) - a threadlike appendages on many cells that is responsible for motility
- Bacterial flagella are composed of a basal body at the base of the flagellum, which attaches it to the cell, and a hook, which connects the basal body to the filament
- The filament is the part of the flagellum that rotates and moves the bacterium
- _*also called unduloppodia (s., undulopodium)_
