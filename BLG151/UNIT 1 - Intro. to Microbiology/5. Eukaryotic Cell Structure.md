# 5.1 - Eukaryotic Cells Are Diverse but Share Some Common Features

---
## Shape and Size
## Cell Organization

**Organelle** - a structure within or on a cell performs specific functions and is related to the cell in a way similar to that of an organ to the body of a multicellular organism


# 5.2 - Eukaryotic Cell Envelopes

---

**Glycocalyx** - a network of polysaccharides extending from the surface of bacteria and other cells

# 5.3 - The Eukaryotic Cytoplasm Contains a Cytoskeleton and Organelles

---

**Cytoplasm** - all material in the cell enclosed by the plasma membrane, with the exception of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells

**Cytosol** - liquid component of the cytoplasm

**Cytoskeleton** - a network of structures made from filamentous proteins (e.g., actin and tubulin) and other components in the cytoplasm of cells

**Actin filaments** - one of the proteinaceous components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton; also called microfilaments

**Microtubules** - one of the proteinaceous components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, flagella, and cilia; composed of tubulin proteins




# 5.4 - Several Organelles Function in the Secretory and Endocytic Pathways

---
## Endoplasmic Reticulum

**Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** - a system of membranous tubules and flattened sacs (cisternae) in eukaryotic cells
- Rough endoplamic reticulum (RER) bears ribosomes on its surface
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) lacks them



## The Golgi Apparatus Prepares Materials for Secretion

**Golgi apparatus** - a membranous eukaryotic organelle composed of stacks (dictyosomes) of flattened sacs (cisternae) involved in packaging and modifying materials for secretion and many other processes

## Lysosomes Are Degradative Organelles that Function in Endocytic Pathways

**Lysosome** - a spherical membraneous eukaryotic organelle that contain hydrolytic enzymes and is responsible for the intracellular digestion of substance


## Transport and Secretory Pathways Move Molecules to Other Locations, Including Outside the Cell

**Secretory pathway** - the process used by eukaryotic cells to synthesize proteins and lipids, followed by secretion or delivery to organelles or the plasma membrane

**Proteasome** - a large, cylindrical protein complex observed in eukaryotic cells that degrades ubiquitin-labeled proteins to peptides in an ATP-dependent process
- Also called 26S proteasome
- Similar protein-degrading machinery has been observed in some archaea and bacteria

## There Are Several Endocytic Pathways

**Endocytosis** - the process in which a cell takes up solutes or particles by enclosing them in vesicles pinched off from its plasma membrane
- It often occurs at regions of the plasma membrane coated by proteins such as clathrin and caveolin
- Endocytosis involving these proteins is called clathrin-dependent endocythosis and caveolin-dependent endocytosis, respectively
- When the substance endocytosed fir

## Extracellular Vesicles
# 5.5 - The Nucleus and Ribosomes are Involved in Genetic Control of the Cell

---
## Nucleus
## Eukaryotic Ribosomes Are Larger and Contain Different Molecules than Bacterial and Archaeal Ribosomes

# 5.6 - Mitochondria, Related Organelles, and Chloroplasts are Involved in Energy Conservation

---
## The Aerobic Mitochondrion Belongs to the Family of Mitochondrial-Related Organelles
## Chloroplasts

# 5.7 - Many Eukaryotic Microbes Have External Structures Used for Motility
