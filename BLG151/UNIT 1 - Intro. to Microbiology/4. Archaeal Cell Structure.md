# 4.1 - Archaea Are Diverse but Share Some Common Features

---

**Archaea** - members of the domain Archaea

## Shape, Arrangement, and Size

**Coccus** (s., cocci) - a roughly spherical bacterial or archaeal cell


## Cell Organization

## 
# 4.2 - Archaeal Cell Envelopes Are Structurally Diverse

---

**Cell envelope** - the plasma membrane plus all other external layers

## Archaeal Plasma Membranes Are Composed of Unique Lipids but Function Like Bacterial Membranes

**Glycerol diether lipids** - Archaeal lipids formed when isoprenoid hydrocarbons are linked to glycerol by ether bonds

**Diglycerol tetraether lipids** - Archaeal lipids formed when isoprenoid hydrocarbon are linked to two glycerols by ether bonds



## There Are Many Different Types of Archaea Cell Walls


**S-layer** - a regularly structured layer composed of protein or glycoprotein that lies on the surface of many bacteria and archaea

**Nanotubes** - filaments packed with extracellular membrane vesicles

**Nanopods** - arrays of membrane vesicles enclosed in the S-layer

# 4.3 - Archaeal Cytoplasm Is Similar to Bacterial Cytoplasm

---

**Cytoskeleton** - a network of structures made from filamentous proteins (e.g., actin and tubulin) and other components in the cytoplasm of cells

## Archaeal Ribosomes Are the Same Size as Bacterial Ribosomes but Composed of Different Molecules

**Ribosome** - the organelle where protein synthesis occurs; the message encoded in mRNA is translated here

**Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)** - the RNA present in ribosomes; contributed to ribosome structure and also directly involved in the mechanisms of protein synthesis

## Nucleoid

**Nucleoid** - an irregularly shaped region in a bacterial or archaeal cell containing genetic material

**Chromosome** - the bodies that have most or all of the cell's DNA and contain most of its genetic information (mitochondria and chloroplasts also contain DNA)

**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** - a polynucleotide that constitutes the genetic material of all cellular organisms
- It is composed of deoxyribonucleotides connected by phosphodiester

**Histones** - a small basic protein with large amounts of lysine and arginine that is associated with eukaryotic DNA in chromatin
- Related proteins are observed in many archaea species, where they form archaea nucleosomes

**Nucleosomes** - a complex of histones and DNA found in eukaryotic chromatin and some archaea; the DNA is wrapped around the surface of the histone complex

# 4.4 - Many Archaea Have External Structures Used for Attachment and Motility

---
## Pili

**Cannulae** - tubelike structures extending from the surface of some archaeal cells
- They are through to function in attachment to surfaces

**Hami** - structures extending from the surface of some archaeal cells that terminate in a grappling hooklike apparatus
- They are thought to function in attachment to surfaces
## Archaella and Motility
