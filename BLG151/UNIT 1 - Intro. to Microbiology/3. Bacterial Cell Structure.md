Prokaryotes Lack Compared to Eukaryotes
- Membrane-bound nucleus
- Cytoskeleton
- Membrane bound organelles
- Internal membranous structures
	- Endoplasmic reticulum
	- Golgi apparatus

- Norman Pace (2006) proposed that _prokaryote_ should be abandoned

# 3.2 - Bacteria Are Diverse but Share Some Common Features

---
## Shape, Arrangement, and Size

- Cocci and bacillus are the most common shapes of bacteria

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524132247.png)


**Cocci** (s., coccus) - a roughly spherical bacterial or archaeal cell

**Diplococci** (s., diplococcus) - a pair of cocci

**Bacilli** (s., bacillus) - a rod-shaped bacterium or archaeon

- Coccobacilli are short and wide that they resemble a cocci

**Virbio** - a rod-shaped bacterial cell that is curved to form a commalike shape

**Spirilla** - a rigid, spiral-shaped bacterium

**Spirochete** - a flexible, sprial-shaped bacterium with periplasmic flagella

**Pleomorphic** - refers to cells or viruses that are variable in shape and lack a single, characteristic form

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524132415.png)

- Some bacteria are thought to be multicellular
- Actinobacteria form long filaments called hyphae
- The hyphae forms a network called mycelium and is similar to eukaryotic fungi
- Cyanobacteria, are also filamentous
	- Some form specialized cells within the filament, called heterocyst that carry out nitrogen fixation
- Myxobacteria aggregate to form structures called fruiting bodies

**Hyphae** - the unit of structure of most fungi and some bacteria; a tubular filament

**Mycelium** - a mass of branching hyphae found in fungi and some bacteria

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524132730.png)


- As the ratio of surface area-to-volume increases, the uptake of nutrients and the diffusion becomes more efficient, and facilitates rapid growth
- Rods have a greater nutrient flux across its plasma membrane
- _E. fishelsoni_ has a high convoluted plasma membrane which increases its S/V ration
- Large cells are less likely to be eaten by predatory protists
- Cells that are filamentous, have stalks, or are oddly shaped are also less susceptible to predation

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524133857.png)

## Cell Organization

- Bacterial cells are surrounded by layers, which are called the cell envelope
- The most common
	- Plasma membrane
	- Cell wall
	- Capsule or slime layer
- Since most bacteria do not contain internal, membrane-bound organelles, their interior appears morphologically simple and use capsule or slime layer to help facilitate growth needs
- Genetic material is localized in a region called the nucleoid
- Ribosomes are larger masses called inclusions that are scattered in the cytoplasm
- Pili is used to facilitate gene transfer or attachment to surface
- Flagella is used for locomotion

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524134250.png)

# 3.3 - Bacterial Plasma Membranes Control What Enters and Leaves the Cell 

---

**Cell envelope** - The plasma membrane plus all other external layers

**Plasma membrane** - the selectively permeable membrane surrounding the cell's cytoplasm; also called the cell membrane, plasmalemma, or cytoplasmic membrane
- For most cells it is a lipid bilayer (some archaea have a lipid monolayer) with proteins embedded in it (integral membrane proteins) and associated with the surface (peripheral membrane proteins)

- A primary role of all plasma membranes is that they are selectively permeable barriers
- Location of metabolic processes
	- Respiration
	- Photosynthesis
	- Synthesis of lipids and cell wall constituents
- Some plasma membrane, have extensive intracytoplasmic membrane systems

## Plasma Membrane Structure Is Dynamic

- Plasma membranes are about 7 to 8 nm thick
- Appear as two dark lines on either side of alight interior when imaged by TEM
- Bacterial membrane have roughly equal amounts of lipids and proteins
- Cleavage of membranes by freeze-etching, exposes proteins lying within the membrane lipid bilayer

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524134711.png)

- Most membrane lipids are amphipathic

**Amphipathic** - term describing a molecule that has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions

- Polar ends interact with water and are hydrophilic

**Hydrophilic** - a polar substance that has a strong affinity for water (or is readily soluble in water)

- Non-polar ends are insoluble and associate with each other

**Hydrophobic** - a non-polar substance lacking affinity for water (or which is not readily soluble in water)

- In aqueous environments, amphipathic lipids spontaneously interact to form a bilayer
- Individual phospholipid molecules associate through non-covalent interactions and are in continuous motion in a membrane


![](Pasted%20image%2020250524134941.png)

2 Types of membrane proteins:
1) Peripheral membrane
2) Integral membrane

**Peripheral membrane protein** - the selectively permeable membrane surrounding the cell's cytoplasm; also called the cell membrane, plasmalemma, or cytoplasmic membrane
- Associated with the surface
- Easily removable
- Soluble in aqueous solution and make ~20 to 30% of total membrane proteins


**Integral membrane protein** - the selectively permeable membrane surrounding the cell's cytoplasm; also called cell membrane, plasmalemma, or cytoplasmic membrane
- Embedded in the membrane
- Not easily extracts
- Insoluble in aqueous solution when freed
- Amphipathic
- Many are transport proteins
- Others are involved in energy-conserving processes
	- Electron transport chain

- The accepted model for membrane structure was the fluid mosaic model
- Neither lipid bilayers or membrane proteins are homogeneous
- Related phospholipids comprise of the bulk of plasma membrane with smaller amounts of lipids
	- Steroids
	- Hapanoids
	- Carotenoids

**Hopanoids** - lipids found in bacterial membranes that are similar in structure and function to the sterols found in eukaryotic membranes
- Similar structure to cholesterol
- Rigid planar structure make them more hydrophobic than phospholipids
- Distort the regular bilayer since they are not amphipathic
- Determines where the other integral membrane proteins can reside
- Forms a functional membrane micro-domains

**Functional membrane micro-domains** - a portion of the plasma membrane comprised of distinct lipids that localized protein complexes like secretion systems

**Flotillin** - integral membrane protein that assembles large protein complexes in the plasma membrane

- Regions of lipid variation allow for sub-cellular localization of some proteins

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524140434.png)


## Bacteria Use Many Mechanisms to Bring Nutrients into the Cell

- Energy source is used to create ATP (adenosine triphosphate)

**Macronutrient** - a nutrient that is required in relatively large amounts (carbon and nitrogen)

6 Macronutrients
1. Carbon
2. Oxygen
3. Hydrogen
4. Nitrogen
5. Sulfur
6. Phosphorous

- Found in proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates
- Other macronutrients exist as cations and contribute to enzymes and ribosomes

**Micronutrient** - nutrients required in very small quantities for growth and reproduction
- Also called trace elements

- Often obtained as contaminants in water, glassware, and growth media
- Parts of enzymes, and aid in catalysis of reactions in protein structure

**Growth factors** - organic compounds that must be supplied in the diet for growth because they are essential cell components or precursors of such components and cannot be synthesized by the organism

- Growth factors must be obtained from the environment

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524140914.png)

- Bacteria can only take in dissolved molecules
- Nutrients can be transported into the cell even when their concentration inside is higher than outside
- Bacteria often live in nutrient-poor habitats

Types of Transport Mechanisms
1) Passive diffusion
2) Facilitated diffusion
3) Primary and secondary active tranport
4) Group translocation

### Passive Diffusion

**Passive diffusion** - the movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration as a result of random thermal agitation

- The rate of passive diffusion depends on the size of concentration gradient between the exterior and interior
- A large concentration gradient is required
- Rate of diffusion decreases as more nutrient accumulates in the cell

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524141214.png)

- Water and some gases (O_2 and CO_2), easily cross the plasma membrane by passive diffusion
- Larger molecules, ions, and polar substances must enter the cell by other mechanisms

### Facilitated Diffusion

**Facilitated diffusion** - diffusion across the plasma membrane that is aided by a channel protein or a carrier protein

- Channels are proteins that form pores that pass substances
- Show specificity for substances, but less than carriers

- Carriers are substrate specific
- The carrier diffusion rate results in a curve resembling an enzyme-substrate curve
- Carriers often exhibit a saturation effect, while channels do not

- Channel-mediated facilitated diffusion involved aquaporins
- Facilitated diffusions required no energy
- The gradient can be maintained by converting the transported nutrient to another compound as soon as it enters the cytoplasm (nutrient is metabolized)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524141921.png)

- Bacteria live in environments where nutrient concentrations are low, and facilitated diffusion cannot concentrate nutrients inside cells

### Primary and Secondary Active Transport

3 Types of Active Transport
1) Primary
2) Secondary
3) Group translocation

**Active transport** - the transport of solute molecules across a membrane against a gradient; it requires a carrier protein and the input of energy
- 3 major types are primary active transport, which uses hydrolysis of ATP to power transport, secondary active transport, which uses ion gradients across a membrane to power active transport, and group translocation

**Primary active transport** - the transport of solute molecules across a membrane against a gradient; it requires a carrier protein and the input of energy

- Uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to move substance against a concentration gradient without modification
- Primary active transporters are uniporters

**Uniporters** - carrier proteins that move a single solute across a membrane

**ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters)** - transport systems that use ATP hydrolysis to drive translocation across the plasma membrane; can be used for nutrient uptake (ABC importer) or export of substances (ABC exporter), including protein secretion (ABC protein secretion pathway)

- ABC transporters are primary that move vitamins, ions, and sugars

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524142603.png)

- Most ABC transporters consist of two hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions (domains) with two ATP-binding domains facing the cytoplasm
- Most ABC transporters use solute-binding proteins to deliver the molecule to be transported to the transporter

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524142743.png)

**Secondary active transport** - couples the potential energy of ion gradients to transport substances without modifying them
- Co-transporters since they move two substances

**Symport** - linked transport of two substances across a plasma membrane in the same direction

Antiport - coupled transport of two molecules in which one molecules enters the cell as the other leaves the cell

3 Ways for Secondary Active Transport
1. Bacterial metabolic activity
	1. Generates a protein gradient
2. V-tape ATPase hydrolyzes ATP
	1. Use protein of sodium gradient in plasma membrane
3. Ion gradient
	1. Antiporter brings protons in as sodium ions

Ex. of Secondary Active Transport
- Lactose permease of _E. coli_
- Single proteins that transports a lactose molecule and proton inwards
- Lactose and proton bind to separate sites on the outward-facing conformation of the carrier, and changes it to inward-facing; sugar and proton are released into the cytoplasm

- When several transport systems exist it changes the properties
	- Energy souce
	- Affinity for solute
	- Nature of their regulation

### Group Translocation

**Group translocation** - an active transport process in which a molecules is moved across a membrane by carrier proteins while being chemically altered at the same time (e.g., phosphoeonolypyruvate: sugar phosphtransferase system)

**Phospheonopyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS)** - a group translocation system used by many bacteria
- As a sugar is transported into the cell, the hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphase bond fuels its import, and the sugar is modified by the covalent attachment of the phosphoryl group

- Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is a common metabolic intermediate in bacteria

**Phosphorelay system** - a set of proteins involved in the transfer of phosphate from one protein in the set to another
- It is often used to regulate protein activity or transcription


![](Pasted%20image%2020250524160212.png)


- Transfer of phosphate from PEP involved proteins
- PTS consists of two enzymes and a low molecular weight heat-stable protein (HPr)
	- For _E. coli_ and _Salmonella_
- A phosphate is transferred from PEP to enzyme II with enzyme I and HPr


### Iron Uptake

- Almost all organisms require iron for building molecules and enzymes (cytochromes)
- Iron is unique because it is extreme insolubility of ferric iron and its derivatives
- Many bacteria secrete siderophores that bind ferric iron and supply its to the cell

**Siderophore** - a small molecules that complexes with ferric iron and supplies it to a cell by aiding in its transport across the plasma membrane

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524162622.png)

- Microorganisms secrete siderophores when iron is scarce in the medium

# 3.4 - Cell Walls Many Functions

---

**Cell wall** - the strong structure that lies outside the plasma membrane; it supports and protects the membrane and helps maintain cell shape

- Cell wall helps maintain cell shape and protects from osmotic lysis, toxic substances
- Also contributes to the ability of a pathogen to cause disease
- Cell wall synthesis is an important target for antibiotics

## Overview of Bacterial Cell Wall Structure

- Gram-postitive
	- Stains purple
	- 20 to 80 nm thick layer of peptidoglycan

- Gram-negative
	- Stains pink
	- Two layers
		- 2 to 7 nm peptidoglycan
		- Covered by a 12 to 14 nm thick outer membrane


**Peptidoglycan** - a large polymer composed of long chains of alternating acetylmuramic acid residues
- The polysaccharide chains are linked to each other through connections between tetrapeptide chains attaches to the N-acetlymuramic acids
- It provides much of the strength and rigidity possessed by bacterial cell walls, also called murein

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524163107.png)

- The space between the plasma and outer membrane is the periplasmic space

**Outer membrane** - a membrane located outside the peptidoglycan layer in the cell envelope of typical Gram-negative bacteria

**Periplasmic space** - the space between the plasma membrane and the outer membrane in typical Gram-negative bacteria, and between the plasma membrane and the cell wall in typical Gram-positive bacteria
- A similar space is sometimes observed between the plasma membrane and the cell wall of some archaea

**Periplasm** - the substance that fills the periplasmic space

- Iain Sutcliffe has proposed that bacterial cell envelopes be recognized by the number of membranes surrounding the cytoplasm

**Monoderm** - a bacterial cell with a single membrane; the plasma membrane
- Gram-positive

**Diderm** - a bacterial cell with two membranes: the plasma membrane and an outer membrane
- Gram-negative

## Peptidoglycan Structure

**Peptide interbridge** - a short peptide chain that connects the tetrapeptide chains in the peptidoglycan of some bacteria

- Peptidoglycan forms a mesh-like structure referred to as the peptidoglycan sacculus
- Peptidoglycan is a single molecule composed of many identical subunits
- Each subunit
	- 2 sugar derivatives
		- _N_-acetlyglucosamine (NAG)
		- _N_-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)
	- Several amino acids
- Amino acids form a short peptide, called stem peptide, consisting of 4 alternating D- and L-amino acids
- D-amino acids protect against degradation by most peptidases

![](Pasted%20image%2020250524163703.png)

- Sacculus if formed by linking the sugars to form a strand
- Strands are cross-links by covalent bonds
- The backbone of each strand is the alternating NAG and NAM residue
- Strand is helical, and stem peptides extend out from the backbone in different directions

2 Types of cross-link
1) Direct
2) Indirect


![](Pasted%20image%2020250524164207.png)

- A direct connects the carboxyl group of an amino acid to one stem peptide to the amino group of an amino acid in another stem peptide

- Bacteria that have indirect linkage use a peptide interbridge, a short chain of amino acids linking the stem peptide of one peptidoglycan strand to another

- The cross-link results in a dense, interconnected network of strands
- Sacculus is strong but elastic
- Able to stretch and contract with osmotic pressure
- Pores enable globular proteins of molecular weight of 50,000 to pass
- Bacteria that stain Gram-positive are more likely to be cross-linked, whereas Gram-negative has less

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525000714.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525000752.png)



## Typical Gram-Positive Cell Walls Consist Primarily of Peptidoglycan

- Most cultured bacteria that stain Gram-positive belong to only two phyla, Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota

**Teichoic acids** - polymers of glycerol or ribitol joined by phosphates; found in the cell walls of most Gram-positive bacteria
- Wall teichoic acids extend beyond the surface of the peptidogylcan
- The negatively charged phosphates give the cell wall its negative charge

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525001035.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525001056.png)


- Teichoic acids create and maintain the structure of the cell envelope by anchoring the wall to the plasma membrane
- They are important during cell division, and they protect the cell from harmful substances in the environment
	- Antibiotics and host defense molecules
- Function in ion uptake
- Involved in binding pathogenic species to host tissues
	- Initiating the infectious disease process


## Typical Gram-Negative Cell Walls Include Additional Layers Besides Peptidoglycan

- Diderm is more widespread than monoderm
- Peptidoglycan layer is thin (2 to 7 nm) and sits within the periplasmic space
- The periplasmic space ranges from ~30 to 70 nm wide
- 20 to 40% of the total cell volume
	- Hydrolytic enzymes
	- Transport proteins
	- Peptidoglycan synthesis
	- Modification of toxic compounds

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525002017.png)

- The outer membrane lies outside the peptidoglycan layer
	- Linked to the cell by Braun's lipoprotein
		- Covalently joined to both the outer membrane and peptide chain of peptidoglycan
- The inner leaflet is composed of phospholipids as found in the plasma membrane
- External layer is comprised of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)

**Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)** - a molecule containing both lipid and polysaccharide, found in the outer membrane of the typical Gram-negative cell wall
- In many bacteria, it consists of three components
	- Lipid A
	- Core polysaccharide
	- O antigen

**Lipid A** - the lipid component of a lipopolysaccharide; also called endotoxin

**Core polysaccharide** - a molecule containing both lipid and polysaccharide, found in the outer membrane of the typical Gram-negative cell wall

**O antigen** - the terminal polysaccharide of the lipoplysaccharide found on some Gram-negative bacterial cell walls

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525002540.png)

- The outer leaflet is comprised of the lipid A which is hydrophobic
- The O antigen projects from the surface

LPS Functions
1) Contributes to negative charge on bacterial surface
2) Helps stabilize outer membrane
3) Create a permeability barrier
4) Protects pathogenic bacteria from host defenses
5) Lipid A acts as a toxin (endotoxin)

O antigen elicits an immune response by an infected host
- A strain of Gram-negative bacteria, such as _E. coli_ O157

- The negatively charged phosphate groups on the core polysaccharide interact with calcium ions to stabilize and tightly pack the LPS molecules
	- Impermeable barrier

- Gram-negative transport process
	1) Solutes cross the outer membrane
		1) Intergral membrane proteins
			1) Porins cluster to form a trimer (3 polypeptides)
	2) Solutes move across the plasma membrane

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525003500.png)

- In contrast, larger molecules (vitamin B12 and iron-siderophore) cross the outer membrane through action of specific receptors
- A solute bound receptor in the outer membrane interacts with the TonB protein complex spanning the periplasm


## Cell Walls and Osmotic Protection

- Without the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, the pressure on the plasma membrane from a hypotonic solution would cause the cell to burst (lysis)
- In Hypertonic solutions, the cell would shrivel (plasmolysis)
- Lysosome attaches the peptidoglycan by hydrolyzing the bond that connects _N_-acetlymuramic acid with _N_-acetylglucosamine
- Penicillin inhibits transpeptidase, which is responsible for making the cross-linked between peptidoglycan chains
- Lysozyme or penicillin on a Gram-positive bacterial results in complete loss of the cell wall, and in an isotonic solution, the cell becomes (protoplast)
- In a Gram-negative, the peptidoglycan sacculus is destroyed, but the outer membrane remains (spheroplast)


**Lysis** - the rupture or physical disintegration of a cell

**Plasmolysis** - the process in which water osmotically leaves a cell, which causes the cytoplasm to shrivel up and pull the plasma membrane away from the cell wall

**Lysozyme** - an enzyme that degrades peptidoglycan by hydrolyzing the B bond that joins acid and

**Protoplast** - the plasma membrane and everything within it
- Bacterial, archaeal, or fungal cell with its cell wall completely removed

**Spheroplast** - a spherical cell formed by the weakening or partial removal of the rigid cell wall component

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525132346.png)

## Bacteria that Lack Cell Walls

- A few bacterial called mycoplasms, are defined by their lack of cell wall
- They are pleomorphic (take different shapes) and osmotically sensitive
- They grow in dilute media or terrestrial environments because their plasma membranes are more resistant to osmotic pressure

# 3.5 - ExtraCellular Vesicles Emerge From Bacterial Membranes

---

**Extracellular vesicles (EVs)** - small vesicles with a lipid bilayer that form by pinching off a portion of a cell membrane
- These contain a sample of the cytoplasm or periplasm
- ~20 to 400 nm
- Develop when a membrane buds out, pinches off, and is released

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525132721.png)

- Gram-positive
	- EVs are formed by plasma membrane and cytoplasm
- Gram-negative
	- Lipopolysaccharide-containing outer membrane surrounding a sample of periplasm (outer membrane vesicles (OMVs))
	- Outer membrane dissociated form Braun's lipoprotein before it can grow outward


**Outer membrane vesicle (OMV)** - a spherical portion of the Gram-negative outer membrane that pinches off to leave the cell
- OMVs may carry proteins, toxins, and nucleic acids

- EVs are not cells, because they do not reproduce
- EVs actively influence a broad range of cell-cell interactions
	- Transfer toxin molecules during infections
	- Transfer genetic material between cell
- Persist in environments longer than makes macromolecules
- Deliver contents to eukaryotic cells after membrane fusion or endocytosis
- EVs fuse with outer membrane of Gram-negative to release the contents to the periplasm

# 3.6 - The Cell Envelope Often Includes Layers Outside the Cell Wall

---

- The layer outside the cell wall is given different names depending on its organization and makeup

## Capsules and Slime Layers

**Capsule** - a layer of well-organized material, not easily washed off, lying outside the cell wall
- Well-organized

- In Gram-negative polysaccharides are covalently bounded, hard to remove
	- _Bacillus anthracis_ has a proteinaceous capsule composed of poly-D-glutamic acid
	- Visible in light microscope, with negative stains or specific capsules stains

Advantages of Capsules
- Help pathogenic bacteria resist phagocytosis by host phagocytes
	- _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, the phagocytosed does not cause disease
- Protect against desiccation because they contain water
- Excluse viruses and most hydrophobic toxic materials (detergents)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250525133542.png)


**Slime layer** - a layer of diffuse, unorganized, easily removed material lying outside an archaeal or bacterial cell wall
- Polysaccharide layer
- More diffuse and unorganized
- Easier to remove
- Not as readily observed by light microscopy
- Gliding bacteria often produce slime, facilitate motility

**Glycocalyx** - a network of polysaccharides extending from the surface of bacteria and other cells
- Encompasses both capsules and slime layers
- Aid in attachment to solid surfaces (tissues in animal and plant hosts)

## S-Layers
