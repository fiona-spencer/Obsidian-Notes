# 3.1 - Use of the Term _Prokaryote_ Is Controversial

---

**Bacteria** - members of the domain Bacteria


# 3.2 - Bacteria Are Diverse but Share Some Common Features

---
## Shape, Arrangement, and Size

**Cocci** (s., coccus) - a roughly spherical bacterial or archaeal cell

**Diplococci** (s., diplococcus) - a pair of cocci

**Bacilli** (s., bacillus) - a rod-shaped bacterium or archaeon

**Virbio** - a rod-shaped bacterial cell that is curved to form a commalike shape

**Spirilla** - a rigid, spiral-shaped bacterium

**Spirochete** - a flexible, sprial-shaped bacterium with periplasmic flagella

**Pleomorphic** - refers to cells or viruses that are variable in shape and lack a single, characteristic form

**Hypae** - the unit of structure of most fungi and some bacteria; a tubular filament

**Mycelium** - a mass of branching hyphae found in fungi and some bacteria

## Cell Organization


# 3.3 - Bacterial Plasma Membranes Control What Enters and Leaves the Cell 

---

**Cell envelope** - The plasma membrane plus all other external layers

**Plasma membrane** - the selectively permeable membrane surrounding the cell's cytoplasm; also called the cell membrane, plasmalemma, or cytoplasmic membrane
- For most cells it is a lipid bilayer (some archaea have a lipid monolayer) with proteins embedded in it (integral membrane proteins) and associated with the surface (peripheral membrane proteins)


## Plasma Membrane Structure Is Dynamic

**Amphipathic** - term describing a molecule that has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions

**Hydrophilic** - a polar substance that has a strong affinity for water (or is readily soluble in water)

**Hydrophobic** - a non-polar substance lacking affinity for water (or which is not readily soluble in water)

**Peripheral membrane protein** - the selectively permeable membrane surrounding the cell's cytoplasm; also called the cell membrane, plasmalemma, or cytoplasmic membrane
- For most cells its a lipid bilayer (some archaea have a lipid monolayer) with proteins embedded in it (integral membrane proteins) and associated with the surface (peripheral membrane proteins)


**Hopanoids** - lipids found in bacterial membranes that are similar in structure and function to the sterols found in eukaryotic membranes

**Functional membrane micro-domains** - a portion of the plasma membrane comprised of distinct lipids that localized protein complexes like secretion systems

**Flotillin** - integral membrane protein that assembles large protein complexes in the plasma membrane



## Bacteria Use Many Mechanisms to Bring Nutrients into the Cell

**Macronutrient** - a nutrient that is required in relatively large amounts (carbon and nitrogen)

**Micronutrient** - nutrients required in very small quantities for growth and reproduction
- Also called trace elements

**Growth factors** - organic compounds that must be supplied in the diet for growth because they are essential cell components or precursors of such components and cannot be synthesized by the organism



### Passive Diffusion

**Passive diffusion** - the movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration as a result of random thermal agitation

### Facilitated Diffusion

**Facilitated diffusion** - diffusion across the plasma membrane that is aided by a channel protein or a carrier protein

### Primary and Secondary Active Transport

**Active transport** - the transport of solute molecules across a membrane against a gradient; it requires a carrier protein and the input of energy
- 3 major types are primary active transport, which uses hydrolysis of ATP to power transport, secondary active transport, which uses ion gradients across a membrane to power active transport, and group translocation

**Primary active transport** - the transport of solute molecules across a membrane against a gradient; it requires a carrier protein and the input of energy

**Uniporters** - carrier proteins that move a single solute across a membrane

**ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters)** - transport systems that use ATP hydrolysis to drive translocation across the plasma membrane; can be used for nutrient uptake (ABC importer) or export of substances (ABC exporter), including protein secretion (ABC protein secretion pathway)

**Secondary active transport** - the transport 

**Symport** - linked transport of two substances across a plasma membrane in the same direction

Antiport - coupled transport of two molecules in which one molecules enters the cell as the other leaves the cell

### Group Translocation

**Group translocation** - an active transport process in which a molecules is moved across a membrane by carrier proteins while being chemically altered at the same time (e.g., phosphoeonolypyruvate: sugar phosphtransferase system)

**Phospheonopyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS)**

**Phosphorelay system** - a set of proteins involved in the transfer of phosphate from one protein in the set to another
- It is often used to regulate protein activity or transcription

### Iron Uptake

**Siderophore** - a small molecules that complexes with ferric iron and supplies it to a cell by aiding in its transport across the plasma membrane

# 3.4 - Cell Walls Many Functions

---

**Cell wall** - the strong structure that lies outside the plasma membrane; it supports and protects the membrane and helps maintain cell shape

## Overview of Bacterial Cell Wall Structure

**Peptidoglycan** - a large polymer composed of long chains of alternating acetylmuramic acid residues
- The polysaccharide chains are linked to each other through connections between tetrapeptide chains attaches to the N-acetlymuramic acids
- It provides much of the strength and rigidity possessed by bacterial cell walls, also called murein

**Outer membrane** - a membrane located outside the peptidoglycan layer in the cell envelope of typical Gram-negative bacteria

**Periplasmic space** - the space between the plasma membrane and the outer membrane in typical Gram-negative bacteria, and between the plasma membrane and the cell wall in typical Gram-positive bacteria
- A similar space is sometimes observed between the plasma membrane and the cell wall of some archaea

**Periplasm** - the substance that fills the periplasmic space

**Monoderm** - a bacterial cell with a single membrane; the plasma membrane

**Diderm** - a bacterial cell with two membranes: the plasma membrane and an outer membrane

## Peptidoglycan Structure
## Typical Gram-Positive Cell Walls Consist Primarily of Peptidoglycan
## Typical Gram-Negative Cell Walls Include Additional Layers Besides Peptidoglycan
