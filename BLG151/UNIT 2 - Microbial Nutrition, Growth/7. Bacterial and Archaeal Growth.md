# 7.1 - Most Bacteria and Archaea Reproduce by Binary Fission

---

**Binary fission** - asexual reproduction in which a cell separates into two identical daughter cells


# 7.2 - Bacterial Cell Cycles Are Divided into Three Phases

---

**Cell cycle** - the sequence of events in a cell's growth-division cycle between the end of one division and the end of the next
