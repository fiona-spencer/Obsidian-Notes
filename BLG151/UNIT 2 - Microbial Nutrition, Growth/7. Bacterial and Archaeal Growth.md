# 7.1 - Most Bacteria and Archaea Reproduce by Binary Fission

---

**Binary fission** - asexual reproduction in which a cell separates into two identical daughter cells


# 7.2 - Bacterial Cell Cycles Are Divided into Three Phases

---

**Cell cycle** - the sequence of events in a cell's growth-division cycle between the end of one division and the end of the next


## Chromosome Replication and Partitioning

**Origin of replication** - a site on a chromosome or plasmid where DNA replication is initiated

**Replisome** - a large protein complex that copies the DNA double helix to form two daughter chromosomes
## Cytokinesis

**Cytokinesis** - process that apportion the cytoplasm and organelles, synthesize a septum, and divide a cell into two daughter cells during division

**Septation** - the process of formation a cross wall between two daughter cells during cell division

**Nucleoid occlusion** - a mechanism used by many bacteria to prevent premature formation of a septum during binary fission

**Divisome** - a collection of proteins that aggregate at the region in a dividing microbial cell where a septum will form

**Elongasome** - the complex of enzymes that synthesize peptidoglycan during cell growth




## Cellular Growth and Determination of Cell Shape

# 7.3 - Archaeal Cell Cycles are Unique

---

# 7.4 - Growth Curves Consist of Five Phases

---

**Batch culture** - growth of microorganisms in a closed culture vessel without adding fresh or removing old (spent) medium

**Lag phase** - a period following the introduction of microorganisms into fresh culture medium when there is no increase in cell numbers or mass during batch culture

**Exponential phase** - the phase of the growth curve during which the microbial population is growing at a constant and maximum rate, dividing and doubling at regular intervals

**Stationary phase** - the phase of microbial growth in a batch culture when population growth ceases and the growth curve levels off

**Long-term stationary phase** - the phase following the death phase of a growth curve in which the population size remains at a more or less constant low level for an extended period

# 7.5 - Environmental Factors Affect Microbial Growth

---

## Oxygen Concentration

**Obligate aerobes** - organisms that grow only in the presence of oxygen

**Microaerophile** - a microorganisms that requires low levels of oxygen for growth, around 2 to 10%, but is damaged by normal atmospheric oxygen levels

**Faculative anaerobes** - microorganisms that do not require oxygen for growth, but grow better in presence

**Aerotolerant anaerobes** - microbes that grow equally well whether or not oxygen is present

**Obligate anaerobes** - microorganisms that cannot tolerate oxygen and die when exposed to it

**Reactive oxygen species (ROS)** - superoxide radical ($O_2^-$), hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$), singlet oxygen ($O_2$), and hydroxyl radical ($OH^-$) derivatives of oxygen

**Superoxide dismutase (SOD)** - an enzyme found in all aerobes, facultative anaerobes, and microaerophiles that catalyzes the conversion of the radical oxygen species superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and molecules oxygen ($O_2$)

**Catalase** - an enzyme that catalyzes the destruction of hydrogen peroxide

**Peroxidase** - enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide

## Pressure

**Bartolerant** - organisms that can grow and reproduce at high pressures but do not require them

**Piezophilic/barophilic** - describing organisms that prefer or require high pressures for growth and reproduction



## Radiation

**Ionizing radiation** - radiation of very short wavelength and high energy that causes atoms to lose electrons (e.g., ionize)

**Ultraviolet (UV) radiation** - high-energy radiation of short wavelength, about 10 to 400 nm

# 7.6 - Microbial Growth in Natural Environments

---
## Most Microbes Live in Growth-Arrested States

**Eutrophic** - nutrient enriched

**Oligotrophic** - an environment containing low levels of nutrients that support microbial growth

**Alarmone** - a signalling molecules synthesizes in response to cellular stressors that regulates gene activity so the cell survives the stress

## Biofilms Are Common in Nature

**Sessile** - describes a pattern of growth in which microbial cells are attached to a solid substrate

**Planktonic** - describes microbes that are free0living and not attached to a substrate

**Biofilms** - organized microbial communities encased in extracellular polymeric substances and associated with surfaces, often with complex structural and functional characteristics

**Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)** - carbohydrate and nucleic acid polymers secreted by biofilm bacteria that comprise the biofilm matrix

**Emergent properties** - properties of a system that cannot be inferred from the components of the system
- Cells in biofilms are protected from UV light, unlike individual cells


## Cell-Cell Communication Within Microbial Populations

**Quorum sensing** - the process in which bacterial monitor their own population density or the presence of other species of bacteria by sensing the levels of signal molecules (e.g., N-acyl homoserine lactone) released by the microorganims
- When these signal molecules reach a threshold concentration, quorum-dependentgenes are expressed

**Autoinducer** - with respect to quorum sensing, a small moleciles that induces synthesis of the enzyme responsible for the autoinducer's synthesis
