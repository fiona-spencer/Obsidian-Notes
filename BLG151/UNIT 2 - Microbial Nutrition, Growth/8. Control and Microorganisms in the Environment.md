# 8.1 - Microbial Growth and Replication: Targets for Control

---

**Biocide** - chemical or physical agent, usually with a broad spectrum or biological activity, that inactivates microorganisms

**Sterilization** - the process by which all living cells, spores, viruses, and viroids are either destroyed or removed from an object or habitat

**Disinfection** - the killing, inhibition, or removal of microorganisms that may cause disease
- It usually refers to the treatment of inanimate objects wth chemicals

**Sanitization** - reduction of the microbial population on an inanimate object to level judge safe by public health standards

**Antisepsis** - the prevention of infection or sepsis

**Antiseptic** - chemical agent applied to tissue to prevent infection by killing or inhibiting pathogens

**Chemotherapy** - the use of chemical agents to treat disease

**Bactericide** - an agent that kills bacteria

**Fungicide** - an agent that kills fungi

**Viricide** - an agent that inactivates viruses so that they cannot reproduce within host cells

**Bacteriastatic** - inhibiting the growth and reproduction of bacteria

**Fungistatic** - inhibiting the growth and reproduction of fungi





## The Pattern of Microbial Death Mirrors the Pattern of Microbial Growth

**Decimal reduction time (D or D value)** - the time required to kill 90% of the microorganisms or endospores in a sample at a specified temperature





# 8.2 - Microbes Can Be Controlled by Physical Means

---
## Filtration

**Depth filters** - filters composed of fibrous or granular materials that are used to decrease microbial load and sometimes to sterilize solutions

**Membrane filter** - porous material that retains microorganisms as the suspending liquid passes through the pores

**High-efficiency particulate (HEPA) filter** - thick, fibrous constructed to remove 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 um or larger



## Heat

**Autoclave** - an apparatus for sterilizing objects by the use of steam under pressure

**Pasteurization** - the process of heating liquids to destroy microorganisms that can cause spoilage of disease

**Tyndallization** - the process of repeated heating and incubation to destroy bacterial spores



## Radiation

**Ultraviolet (UV) radiation** - high-energy radiation of short wavelength, about 10 to 400 nm

**Cold plasma** - a method of microbial control that uses unstable radicals to disrupt liquids, proteins, and nucleic acids in microbes
- Also known as non-thermal plasma or non-equilibrium plasma

**Ionizing radiation** - radiation of very short wavelength and high energy that causes atoms to lose electrons




# 8.3 - Micro-organisms Are Controlled with Chemical Agents

---
## Phenolics
## Alcohols
## Halogens

**Iodophor** - an antimicrobial agent consisting of an organic compound complexed with iodine


## Metals
## Quaternary Ammonium Compounds

**Detergent** - an organic molecules, other than a soap, that serves as a wetting agent and emulsifier; it is normally used as cleanser, but some may be used as antimicrobial agents


## Aldehydes
## Sterilizing Gases

# 8.4 - Antimicrobial Agents Must Be Evaluated for Effectiveness

---

**Phenol coefficient test** - a measurement of the effectiveness of disinfectants that compares their activity against test bacteria with that of phenol

**Use dilution test** - method of evaluating disinfectant effectiveness at a recommended dilution
