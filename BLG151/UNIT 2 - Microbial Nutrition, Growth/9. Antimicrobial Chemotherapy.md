# 9.1 - Antimicrobial Chemotherapy Evolved from Antisepsis Efforts

---

**Penicillin** - a B-lactam anibiotic
- The first true antibiotic to be discovered and used clinically


# 9.2 - Antimicrobial Drugs Have Selective Toxicity

---

**Selective toxicity** - the ability of a chemotherapeutic agent to kill or inhibit a microbial pathogen while damaging the host as little as possible

**Therapeutic index** - the ratio between the toxic dose and the therapeutic dose of a drug, used as a measure of the drug's relative safety

**Narrow-spectrum drugs** - chemotherapeutic agents effective only against a limited variety of microorganisms

**Broad-spectrum drugs** - chemotherapeutic agents that are effective against many different kinds of pathogens


**Cidal** - causing death

**Static** - inhibiting or retarding growth

**Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)** - the lowest concentration of a drug that will prevent the growth of a particular microorganism

**Minimal lethal concentration (MLC)** - the lowest concentration of a drug that will kill a particular microorganism


# 9.3 - Antimicrobial Activity Can Be Measured by Specific Tests

---
## Dilution Susceptibility Tests
## Disk Diffusion Tests

**Kibry-Bauer method** - a disk diffusion test to determine the susceptibility of a microorganism to chemotherapeutic agents


## The Etest

# 9.4 - Antibacterial Drugs

---
## Inhibitors of Cell Wall Synthesis
### Penicillins

**B-lactam ring** - the cyclic chemical structure composed of one nitrogen and three carbon atoms
- It has anitbacterial activity, interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis

**Penicillinase** - a B-lactamase enzyme that digests the active moiety of penicillin


## Cephalosporins
### Carbapenems and Monobactam

**Carbapenems** - a group of broad-spectrum B-lactam antibiotics typically resistant to B-lactamases

### Vancomycin

**Vancomycin** - a glycopeptide anitbiotic that is effective only against Gram-positive bacteria and inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis

## Protein Synthesis Inhibitors
### Amino-glycosides

**Aminoglycoside antibiotics** - a group of antibiotics that contain a cyclohexane ring and amino sugars; all aminoglycosode antibiotics inhibit protien synthesis by bining

### Tetracyclines

**Tetracyclines** - a family of anitbiotics with a common four-ring structure that is isolated from the genus _Streptomyces_ or produced semisynthetically


### Macrolides

**Mactrolide antibiotics** - an antibiotic containing a macrolide ring - a large lactone ring with multiple keto and hydroxyl groups - linked to one or more sugars

### Lincosamides
### Oxazolidinones

**Oxazolidinones** - synthetic drugs, characterized by a heterocylic five-membered ring, that inhibit protein synthesis

## Metabolic Antagonists

**Antimetabolite** - a compound that blocks metabolic pathway function by competitively inhibiting a key enzyme because it closely resembles the normal enzyme substrate


### Sulfonamindes or Sulfa Drugs

### Trimethoprim


**Trimethoprim** - a synthetic antibotic that inhibits production of folic acid by binging to dihydrofolate reductase
- Trimethoprim had a wide spectrum of activity and is bacteriostatic

## Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibition
### Fluoroquinolones

**Fluoroquinolones** - a group of broad-spectrum bacteriocidal agents that block DNA gyrase and topoisemerase IV

### Rifamycins

**Rifamycins** - semi-synthetic antibacterial drugs that block transcription by binding to bacterial RNA polymerase

# 9.5 - Antiviral Drugs

---

# 9.6 - Antifungal Drugs

---

# 9.7 - Antiprotozoan Drugs

---

**Artemisinin** - an antimalarial drugused in combination with at least oneother antimalarial drug for tretreatment for infections cause by _Plasmodium falciparum_

**Metronidazole** - antimicrobial chemotherapeutic agent of the nitromidazole family having biological activity on anaerobic bacteria and protozoa


# 9.8 - Antimicrobial Drug Resistance Is a Public Health Threat

---
## There Are Several Mechanisms of Drug Resistance

**Efflux pumps** - membrane-associated protein assemblies that transport amphiphilic molecules from cytoplasm to the extracellular environment

## Detecting Drug Resistance
## Overcoming Drug Resistance
