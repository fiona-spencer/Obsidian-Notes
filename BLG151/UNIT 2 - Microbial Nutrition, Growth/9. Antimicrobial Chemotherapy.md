# 9.1 - Antimicrobial Chemotherapy Evolved from Antisepsis Efforts

---

**Penicillin** - a B-lactam anibiotic
- The first true antibiotic to be discovered and used clinically


# 9.2 - Antimicrobial Drugs Have Selective Toxicity

---

**Selective toxicity** - the ability of a chemotherapeutic agent to kill or inhibit a microbial pathogen while damaging the host as little as possible

**Therapeutic index** - the ratio between the toxic dose and the therapeutic dose of a drug, used as a measure of the drug's relative safety

**Narrow-spectrum drugs** - chemotherapeutic agents effective only against a limited variety of microorganisms

**Broad-spectrum drugs** - chemotherapeutic agents that are effective against many different kinds of pathogens


**Cidal** - causing death

**Static** - inhibiting or retarding growth

**Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)** - the lowest concentration of a drug that will prevent the growth of a particular microorganism

**Minimal lethal concentration (MLC)** - the lowest concentration of a drug that will kill a particular microorganism


# 9.3 - Antimicrobial Activity Can Be Measured by Specific Tests

---
## Dilution Susceptibility Tests
## Disk Diffusion Tests

**Kibry-Bauer method** - a disk diffusion test to determine the susceptibility of a microorganism to chemotherapeutic agents


## The Etest

# 9.4 - Antibacterial Drugs

---
## Inhibitors of Cell Wall Synthesis
### Penicillins

**B-lactam ring** - the cyclic chemical structure composed of one nitrogen and three carbon atoms
- It has anitbacterial activity, interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis

**Penicillinase** - a B-lactamase enzyme that digests the active moiety of penicillin


## Cephalosporins
### Carbapenems and Monobactam

**Carbapenems** - a group of broad-spectrum B-lactam antibiotics typically resistant to B-lactamases

### Vancomycin

**Vancomycin** - a glycopeptide anitbiotic that is effective only against Gram-positive bacteria and inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis

## Protein Synthesis Inhibitors
### Amino-glycosides

**Aminoglycoside antibiotics** - a group of antibiotics that contain a cyclohexane ring and amino sugars; all aminoglycosode antibiotics inhibit protien synthesis by bining

### Tetracyclines

**Tetracyclines** - a family of anitbiotics with a common four-ring structure that is isolated from the genus _Streptomyces_ or produced semisynthetically


### Macrolides

**Mactrolide antibiotics** - an antibiotic containing a macrolide ring - a large lactone ring with multiple keto and hydroxyl groups - linked to one or more sugars

### Lincosamides
### Oxazolidinones



## Metabolic Antagonists

### Sulfonamindes or Sulfa Drugs

### Trimethoprim
## Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibition
### Fluoroquinolones
### Rifamycins
