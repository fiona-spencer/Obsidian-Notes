Apical meristems - A group of undifferent plant cells, at the tip of a shoot or root, that is responsible for primary growth

Primary growth - In plants, an increase in the length of stems and roots due to the activity of apical meristems

Primary plant body - All of the cells and tissues derived from apical meristem and primary meristems
