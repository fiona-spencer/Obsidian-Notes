- Animals have survived for about 800 millions years of evolution from a common eukaryotic ancestor
- Only about 1.4 million animal species have been describes and given scientific names to date
- Humans rely on other animals for food, materials, labour, services such as pollination, and their major ecological roles in maintaining ecosystem functions
- Animals also play an important role in causing and transmitting human diseases and in helping scientists to cure them

**The Canadian Healthy Oceans Network (CHONe)**
- Canada has the world's largest territorial sea
- 2/3 of the major phyla of organisms in Canada live in marine habitats
- As the polar ice caps melt, industrial development of Arctic waters becomes increasingly likely
- The CHONe partners with researchers and government scientists, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of Canada's marine biodiversity

# ==30.1 - What Is an Animal?==

---

- Similarly to land plants and fungi, animals originated from single-celled protists
- Animals occur in a clade, or lineages, called Opisthokonta
- Choanoflagellates are the closest living relatives, or sister group, to animals, sharing a common ancestor about 900 mya

![[Pasted image 20250408144343.png|300]]

**Animals** - A member of a major lineage of eukaryotes (Animalia) whose members typically have a complex, multicellular body; eat other organisms; and move under their own power at some point in their lives

Key Traits of Animals:
1) Multicellular, cells that lack cell walls but have an extensive extracellular matrix
	1) The ECM includes proteins specialized for cell-cell adhesion and communication
2) Heterotrophs
	1) Obtain carbon compounds from other organisms
3) Move under their own power in their life time
4) Other than sponges, have nerve cells that transmit electrical signals to other cells, and muscle cells that can change the shape of the body by contracting

**Extracellular matrix (ECM)** - A complex fibre composite in which animal cells are embedded, consisting of proteins (e.g. collagen, proteoglycan and extracellular keratins) and polysaccharides produced by the cell

- Multicellular fungi and animals are similar in that they are both multicellular heterotrophs that digest and absorb nutrients
- Animals are the only multicellular heterotrophs on the tree of life that usually ingest their food, before they digest it
- Digestion in animals occurs within a space, or lumen, of the digestive tract rather than the surrounding environment

**Cambrian explosion** - The rapid diversification of animal body types and lineages that occurred during a 50 million year period about 541 mya at the start of the Proterozoic eon

- In most animals neurons connect to each other, forming a nervous system, and some neurons connect to muscle cells, that contract in response to electrical signals from neutrons
- Muscles and neurons are adaptations that allow large bodies to move efficiently
- Animals are the largest and most complex detritivores, herbivores, and carnivores
- The radiation of animals began 550 mya during the Cambrian explosion
- After, diverse animals appears in the fossil record with muscles, nerves, shells, exoskeletons, internal skeletons, legs, heads, tails, brains, eyes, antennae, jaw-like mandibles, and segmented bodies

**Phyla** - In Linnaeus' system, a taxonomic category above the class level and below the kingdom level
- In plants, sometimes called a division

- Biologists recognize 30-35 phyla of animals

An Overview of Major Animal Phyla
1) Non-bilaterian groups
	1) Placozoa
	2) Ctenophora
	3) Acoela
	4) Porifera
	5) Cnidaria
2) Protostomes
	1) Chaetognatha
	2) Lophotrochozoa
	3) Ecdysozoa
3) Deutersostomes
	1) Hermichordata
	2) Echinodermata
	3) Chordata

# ==30.2 - What Key Innovations Occurred during the Origin of Animal Phyla?==

---

**Body plan** - The basic architecture of an animal's body, including the number and arrangement of limbs, body segments, and major tissue layers

- 4 main sources of evidence of animal evolution
	1) Fossils
		1) Provide direct evidence of animal shape, and location
		2) Fossils are more likely to occur when species are abundant, or in better suited environments where sedimentation was occurring, or lived recently
	2) Comparative morphology
		1) Provides information about which larval or adult morphological characteristic can be used to define the fundamental architecture, or body plan, of each animal lineage
		2) Infer which characteristics evolved first in phylogenetic context
	3) Comparative development (evo-devo)
		1) Provides information about patterns of gene expression and morphological change during development
		2) Reveal when diverse structures are determines by similar (homology)/different (convergent evolution) genes and developmental processes
	4) Comparative genomics
		1) Provides information about the relative similarity of genes or whole genomes of diverse organisms
		2) Insight into phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history


- The various sources of data on animal evolution suggest either the same sequence of evolutionary events (internal consistency) or contradictory events
- The phylogeny of animals was published 1887
- Using sequences from a gene that codes for RNA in the small subunit of the ribosomes

![[Pasted image 20250408144419.png|500]]
# Origin of Multicellularity

- Animals are a monophyletic group, and share a common ancestor that was multicellular
- Data from fossils, comparative morphology comparative development, and comparative genomics agree on a single origin of animals
- The prevailing hypothesis is that sponges (phylum Porifera) are the most ancient lineage of animals

*Fossil Evidence for the Sponges-First Hypothesis*
- Sponges appear in the fossil records, more than 700 mya
- At the presence of multicellular sponges there was an absence of fossils of other multicellular organisms
- Geochemical evidence from rocks suggest that the oxygen concentration in the Precambrian atmosphere and oceans were a tiny fraction of the levels in the Cambrian and beyond
- Small sponges living today show that they can survive in oxygen concentrations as low as 0.5-4.0%


*Morphological Evidence for the Sponges-First Hypothesis*

**Benthic** - Living at the bottom of an aquatic environment
**Sessile** - Permanently attached to a substrate; not capable of moving to another location
**Choanocytes** - A specialized, flagellated feeding cell found in sponges (the most ancient animal phylum)
**Colonies** - The portion of the large intestine where feces are formed by compaction of wastes and reabsorption of water
**Epithelium** - An animal tissue consisting of sheet-like layers of tightly packed cells that line an organ, a gland, a duct, or a body surface

- Sponges share several key characteristics with the choanoflagellate outgroup
	- Both are benthic and sessile
	- Both feed in s similar way, using cells with nearly identical morphology
	- The beating flagella of choanoflagellates and specialized cells in sponges called choanocytes trap bacteria and organic debris
	- The trapped food particles are then digested inside the cell body or within other cells of the sponge
	- Feeding occurs at the cellular level, unlike feeding in all other animals

![[Pasted image 20250408144444.png|500]]

- Choanoflagellates sometimes form colonies
- Some biologists once considered sponges to be colonies of single-celled protists due to the ability of sponge cells to reaggregate after being dissociated
- Sponges contain many specialized cell types that are dependent on each other, some of which occur in organized layers surrounded by ECM
- Research shows that one group of sponges has true epithelium
- Epithelium is essential to animal form and function


*Molecular Evidence for the Sponges-First Hypothesis*

**Tool-kit genes** - A set of key developmental genes that established the body plan of animals; and plants; present at the origin of the multicellular lineages and elaborates upon over evolutionary time by a process of duplication and divergence, includes Hox genes

- Many molecular phylogenies show the sponges branching off first during the diversification of animals
- Animal development is driven by a small number of regulatory genes controlling a large number of effector genes
- Each regulatory gene makes a transcription factor protein that can control multiple downstream genes
- Theses downstream genes encode the protein needed by cells and tissues to perform their appropriate function
- Different animals often rely upon the same regulatory genes
- Animals use the same genes during early embryogenesis
- These, genes are called developmental tool-kit genes, that control the basic molecular processes common to all animals:
	- Specialization of cell types
	- Regulation of cell cycling and growth
	- Adhesion among cells, and between cells and extracellular matrix
	- Recognition of self and non-self, thus innate immunity
	- Developmental signalling and gene regulation
	- Programmed cell death
- Duplication and diversification of these genes contributed to the diversification of animal lineages


*Alternative Views: The Ctenophores-First Hypothesis*
- New genomic data has produced an alternative hypothesis
- Recent studies suggest that the Ctenophora, or comb jellies, are the sister group to all other animals
- This is based on the pattern of gains and losses of certain genes in ctenophores compared to the others
	- Ctenophores are the only animal that lacks microRNAs, important regulators of gene expression

*Insight from the Origin-of-Animals Debate*
- New important insights to the animal lineage
	1. The evolution of animals is more complicated than a smooth transition form simple to complex
		1. Newer species do not have larger genomes than simpler animals
	2. Many key innovations did not arise all at once
		1. Covergent evolution or homologous regulatory genes
	3. Evolution did not stop within any of the lineages

# Origin of Embryonic Tissue Layers and Muscle

Tissues - A group of cells that function as a unit, such as muscle tissue in an animal or xylem tissue in a plant





*Origin of Embryonic Tissue Layers*

**Diploblasts** - An animal whose body develops from two basic embryonic cell layers or tissues, ectoderm, and endoderm

**Triploblasts** - An animal whose body develops from three basic embryonic cell layers or tissues, ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm

**Germ layer** - In animals, one of the three embryonic tissue layers formed during gastrulation; gives rise to all other tissues and organs

**Ectoderm** - The outermost of the three basic cell layers in most animal embryos; gives rise to the outer covering and nervous system

**Mesoderm** - The middle of the three basic cell layers in most animal embryos; gives rise to muscles, bones, blood, and some internal organs (kidney, spleen)

**Endoderm** - The innermost of the three basic cell layers in most animal embryos; gives rise to the digestive tract and organs that connect to it (liver, lungs)

**Mesoglea** - A gelatinous material, containing scattered ectodermal cells, that is located between the ectoderm and endoderm of cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, and anemones)

- Animals, other than sponges, are distinguished by the number of embryonic tissue layers they have
- Animal embryos have two types of tissues called diploplasts and triploblasts
- The embryonic tissues are organized in layers, called germ layers, the differentiate during development
- The  diploblasts have ectoderm and endoderm
- In most cases, the outer and inner "skins" are connected by a mesoglea
- The triploblasts have a mesoderm between

Development of animal layers into tissues, organs, and organs systems:
- Ectoderm
	- Skin
	- Nervous system
- Mesoderm
	- Circulatory system
	- Muscle
	- Internal structures
		- Bone
		- Most organs
- Endoderm
	- Lining of the digestive tract
	- Organs that connect to the digestive tract
		- Liver
		- Lungs

- Ectoderm produces the covering of the animal
- Mesoderm gives rise to the tissues in between
- Endoderm generates the digestive tract and associated structures

- Some ctenophores and cnidarians contain effector genes coding for structural components found in mesodermal cells, however do no have the regulatory genes
- Mesoderm of triploblasts are the product of convergent morphological evolution from homologous genes; this is deep homology


*Origin of Muscle*
- Both larval and adult ctenophores swim using cilia
- Some species, the adult has contractile tissue that can change the body's shape and create movement
- All animals share homologous genes for contractile proteins
- Sponges can use actin and myosin to move
- These proteins are derived from endoderm called epitheliomuscular cells, which are functionally similar to true mesodermal muscle cells, but evolved independently
- All of the genes needed to form muscles did not evolve all at once
- Protein that pre-date the diversification of triploblasts were co-opted and elaborated upon in different lineages
- This created animal groups with similar functionality from independent evolutionary paths, from convergent evolution with deep homology


# Origin of Bilateral Symmetry, Cephalization, and the Nervous System

**Radial symmetry** - An animal body pattern that has at least two planes of symmetry. Typically, the body is in the form of a cylinder or disk, and the body parts radiate from a central hub

**Biradial symmetry** - An animal body pattern that has two planes of symmetry. Typically, the body is in the form of a cylinder or disk

**Bilateral symmetry** - An animal body pattern in which one plane of symmetry divides the body into a left side and right side. Typically, the body is long and narrow, with a distinct head end and tail end

- Body symmetry is a key morphological aspect of an animal's body plan
- Ctenophores, many cnidarians, some sponges have radial symmetry ("spoke symmetry")
- Many ctenophores have a biradial symmetry, which is a rotational symmetry

![[Pasted image 20250318080334.png|500]]

- Bilateral symmetry ("two-sided symmetry") have one plane of symmetry and long, narrow body
	- Worms
- Radial symmetry appear earlier in the evolution of animals, than bilateral
- Bilaterial symmetry occurs in triploblastic lineages

*Bilateral Symmetry: Homology or Convergent Evolution?*

**Bilaterians** - A member of a major lineage of animals (Bilateria) that are bilaterally symmetrical at some point in their life cycle, have three embryonic germ layers, and have a coelom (or evolved from ancestors that has a coelom)
- All protostomes and deuterostomes

- Some species appear to be radially symmetric, but may be bilateral in the internal morphology
- Sea anemone are diploblasts, but have a bilateral symmetric retractor muscles
- Bilaterians have body's achieved by the combination of anterior-posterior axis formation and dorsal-ventral axis formation
- *Hox* genes are regulatory genes that are important in the development of the anterior-posterior axis
- They regulate the expression and establish regional identities
- The *decapentaplegic (dpp)* are genes that develop the dorsal-ventral axis
- Evidence supports the hypothesis that bilateral symmetry in sea anemone is homologous to bilateral symmetry arose in triploblasts animals
- Therefore, genes that determine bilateral symmetry arose before the evolutionary split of the cnidarians and bilaterian lineages

![[Pasted image 20250318081159.png|600]]

- Entire set of regulatory and effector genes necessary for bilateral symmetry did not evolve all at one in the early Cambrian before the diversification of bilaterians
- Some genes evolved earlier, and others evolved or were later co-opted differently after the split of these two lineages
- The presence of *Hox, dpp*, and other developmental regulatory genes in cnidarians support the hypothesis, that cnidarians are a sister group to the bilaterians


*Origin of the Nervous System*

**Ganglia** - A mass of neuron in a centralized nervous system

**Central nervous system (CNS)** - An aggregation of large number of neurons into clusters called ganglia in bilaterian animals. In vertebrates, the CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord

**Cephalization** - The formation in animals of a distinct anterior region where sense organs and a mouth are clustered

**Brain** - A large mass of neurons, located in the head regions of an animal, that is involved in the information processing; may also be called the cerebral ganglion

- Over 99% of the modern animals are overtly bilaterally symmetric
- A hypothesis suggests the evolution of the nervous system is linked to bilateral symmetry
- The function of neurons and nervous system is to transmit and process information in the form of electrical signals
	- Sponges lack nerve cells, but have essential genes for the development and function of nerves
	- Cnidarians have nerve cells that are mostly organized into a diffuse arrangement called a nerve net
	- A diffuse nerve net can receive and send signals efficiently
	- Clusters of nerves occur adjacent to sensory cells, such as near the mouth
	- Ctenophores have a nerve net, nerves associated with the tentacles, and specialized sensory organs used for sensing light and gravity
	- Some research shows that ctenophores also have clusters of nerves, called ganglia
	- The nervous system ranges from a nerve net to a more complex central nervous system
	- In a CNS, some neurons are clustered into one or more large tracts or cords that project throughout the body
	- Other are clustered into a ganglia
	- Bilateral symmetric organisms encounter prey and the environment at the leading end
	- With nerve tracts that carry information down the length of the body

![[Pasted image 20250318090904.png|400]]

- CNS coincides with cephalization: the evolution of a head, or anterior region, where structures for feeding, sensing the environment, and processing information are concentrated
- The mass of neurons located in the head is called the cerebral ganglion, or brain
- Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that these structures did not arise in a common ancestor
- Rather, the set of regulatory and effector genes evolved early and was co-opted multiple times in different lineages via convergent evolution
- Cephalization and a CNS enabled directed movement and hunting

# Origin of the Gut and Coelom

**Coelom** - An internal, usually fluid-filled body cavity that is completely or partially lined with mesoderm

**Coelomates** - An animal that has a true coelom, completely lined with mesoderm

**Acoelomates** - A bilaterian animal that lacks an internal body cavity

**Pseudocoelomates** - An animal that has a coelom that is only partially lined wth mesoderm

- Cnidarians have a body plant that looks like a sac
- Only one opening to the environment use for ingestion of food, release of gametes, and elimination of wastes; gastrovascular cavity
- Ctenophores expel wastes through two tiny anal pores
	- Therefore, some materials pass through the gastrovascular cavity in one direction

- The basic bilaterian body shape is a tube within a tube, where materials typically move in one direction
- The inner tube is the individual's gut with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other
- The outer tube forms the skin and a nervous system
- The mesoderm in between forms muscles and organs
- Recent research suggests that anal pores arose independently in ctenophores, yet co-opts some of the same genes that are responsible for bilaterian posteriors; another example of deep homology
- Some bilaterians have a fluid-filled cavity associated with the mesodermally derived tissues called a coelom
- The coelom provides a space for circulation of oxygen and nutrients
	- It also enable the internal organs to move independently of each other and independently of the inner and outer tubes
	- Bilaterian with a coelom that is completely lined with mesodermally derived tissues have a true coelom; coelomates
	- Bilaterians that have no coelom, such as the flatworms, are acoelomates
	- Bilaterians whose coelom is partially lined, such as roundworms, and rotifers, are pseudocoelomates

![[Pasted image 20250318105924.png|500]]

- Earlier phylogenies based on morphological data predicated a gradual evolution from simple acoelomates to pseudocoelomates to coelomates
- Although, molecular data suggests that the coelom arose in the ancestral bilateral and was subsequently modified, reduced, or lost in many lineages
	- Flatworm phylogeny suggests their ancestors had a coelom, but lost it
- The most diverse animals on Earth, the arthropods, have a highly reduced coelom called a hemocoel

# Origin of Protostomes and Deuterostomes

**Protostomes** ("first mouth") - A major lineage of bilaterian animals that share a pattern of embryological development, including formation of the mouth easier than the anus, and formation of the coelom by splitting of a block of mesoderm
- Arthropods, mollusks, and annelids

**Deuterostomes**  ("second mouth") - A major lineage of bilaterian animals that includes echinoderms and chordates; named for the embryonic development of the anus before the mouth

- Two major subgroups of Bilateria are the Protostomes, and Deuterostomes and are separated by embryonic development
- Embryonic germ layers form during a process called gastrulation, which begins when cells move from the surface into the interior of the embryo
- These cell movements create a pore that opens to the outside, called a blastopore
- In deuterostomes, the blastopore becomes the anus; the mouth forms after
- In protostomes, the blastopore develops either the anus, or mouth first, or both
- Mesoderm-forming processes occur in both groups
- Two major groups within protostomes
	- Lophotrochozoa
		- Mollusks, annelids, flatworms, rotifers
		- Ecdysozoa
			- Arthropods, nematodes
- The vast majority of animal species are protostomes
- The largest animals and predators tend to be deuterostomes

**Lophotrochozoans** - A major lineage of protostomes that grow by extending their skeletons rather than moulting. Many phyla have a specialized feeding structure (lophophore) and/or ciliated larvae (trochophore)
- Rotifers, flatworms, segmented worms, mollusks

Ecdysozoans - A major lineage of protostomes that grow by shedding their external skeletons (moulting) and expanding their bodies
- Arthropods, nematodes, and other groups

# Origin of Segmentation

**Segmentation** - Division of the body or a part of it into a series of similar structures; exemplified by the body segment of insects and worms and by the somites of vertebrates

**Vertebrates** - One of the three major chordate lineages (Vertebrata), comprising animals with a dorsal column of cartilaginous or bony structures (vertebrae) and a skull enclosing the brain
- Fishes, amphibians, mammals, reptiles (including birds)

**Invertebrates** - A paraphyletic group composed of animals without a backbone; includes about 95% of all animal species

- The vertebrate is the defining trait of the monophyletic group within the Chordata that includes fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals
- Invertebrates are a paraphyletic group
- A recent study found that the hedgehog pathway is an important regulatory pathways for segmentation in annelid worms
- Regulatory genes for segmentation arose early in animal evolution, meaning that they are homologous in different phyla, rather than evolving independently
- Although, these genes would subsequently have been lost in some lineages and co-opted in different ways, resulting in the convergent evolution of morphological segmentation in distantly related phyla
- Segmentation enables specialization
- Small changes in the *Hox* genes, along the length of the body can result in novel numbers, shapes, and sized of body segments and appendages


# ==30.3 - What Themes Occur in the Diversification of Animals within Phyla?==

---

- Animals diversified tremendously within phyla after the Cambrian, but no major new lineages arose during the last 500 million years
- One mechanistic hypothesis is that gene regulatory networks are responsible for limiting the origin of new body plans
- Gene regulatory networks determine patterns of animal development

Adaptive Radiation of Animals:
- Higher oxygen levels
	- Oxygen levels increased around the start of the Cambrian
	- Large, mobile animals could use aerobic respiration
- Rise of a higher-quality food source
	- More energy and mass were available for growth and reproduction
- The evolution of predation
	- Exerted selection pressure on skeletons, rapid movement, and other adaptations for escaping capture
- New niches beget more new niches
	- New niches that could support yet more ecological diversification
- Modified genes, modified bodies
	- Duplication and diversification of *Hox* genes, the potential for morphological diversity increased

- Animals with the same body plan diversified in their strategies for finding food, ingesting food, and reproducing in different ecological niches

# Sensory Organs

- The evolution of the cephalized body was a major breakthrough in the evolution of animals
- In addition was a mouth, and brain, a concentration of sensory organs in the head region
- Common senses include sight, hearing, taste/smell, and touch
- A wide array of specialized sensory abilities also evolved
	- Magnetic field
		- Birds, sea turtles, sea slugs can detect Earth's magnetic field and use it as an aid in navigation
	- Electric field
		- Some aquatic predators, such as sharks, are sensitive to electric fields and can detect electrical activity in the muscles of passing prey
	- Barometric pressure
		- Some birds can sense changes in air pressure, which can aid them in avoiding storms
	- Gravity
	- Temperature

# Feeding

- Animals within a lineage often pursue the same or different food sources and feeding strategies when they occupy different niches
	- Sea cucumbers and sea stars both have an echinoderm body plan, but they have different food and feeding strategies
	- Burrowing sea cucumbers and some burrowing polychaete worms have different body plans, but use similar food/feeding strategies


*What Animals Eat: Diversification of Ecological Roles*

**Detritivores** - An organism whose diet consists mainly of dead organic matter (detritus)
- Various bacteria, fungi, protists, and animals
- Also called decomposers

**Herbivores** - An animal that eats primarily plants and rarely or never eats meat

**Carnivores** - An animal whose diet consists predominantly of meat, or other animals

**Omnivores** - An animal whose diet regularly includes a variety of organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and/or bacteria


- A way to classify animals is how they eat
- Another way to categorize the diverse ecological impacts of animal consumption is the effect on the organisms that are consumes
- More carnivores are predators that kill their prey
- Predators kill using an array of mouthparts and hunting strategies
- Most herbivores consume plant tissue, such as leaves and seeds, without killing the whole organism
- Some carnivores and herbivores are parasites
- They are smaller then the host they feed on, and harvest nutrients
- Endoparasites live inside their hosts, and usually have simple worm-like bodies (ex. tapeworms)
- They absorb nutrients through their skin
- Ectoparasites live on the outside of their hosts (ex. ticks)
- Use limbs or mouthparts that grasp to the host, and pierce/suck the nutrient-rich fluids
- Animals are an important agent of natural selection, influencing the evolution of the species they eat

**Predator** - Any organism that kills another organism for food

**Parasites** - Any organism that lives on a host species (ectoparasite) or in a host species (endoparasite) and that damages its host

**Endoparasites** - A parasite that lives inside the host's body

**Ectoparasites** - A parasite that lives on the outer surface of the host's body


*How Animals Feed: Four General Strategies*

- The structure of an animal's mouthparts correlates with its method of feeding

**Suspension feeders/filter feeders** - An animal that obtains food by filtering small particles or small organisms out of water

**Deposit feeders** - An animal that eats its way through a food-containing substrate

**Fluid feeders** - An animal that feeds by sucking or mopping up liquids such as nectar, plant sap, or blood

**Mass feeders** - An animal that ingests chucks of food

- Many sessile organisms are suspension feeders and mostly occurs in aquatic animals with particles that float in water
	- Sponges, baleen whales, clams, mussels
- Some terrestrial animals suspension feed on aquatic animals
	- Flamingoes
- Spiders suspension feed on flying insects
- Deposit feeders digest organic matter in the sediments of sand, mud-dwelling bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi, and detritus
	- Earthworms
- Deposit feeders help clear organic material and dead organisms that build up, and help mix soil and carry nutrients into the ground
- Deposit feeds tend to be similar in appearance with a simple mouthpart, and worm-like body
- Fluid feeders range from feeding on nectar with a straw-like proboscis (butterflies, and moths) to vampire bats that feed on blood
- Mouthpart allow them to pierce seeds, stems, skin, or other structure
- Houseflies mop up liquid with sponge-like mouthparts
- Mass feeders use their mouthparts to ingest large pieces of food
- Have sharp teeth for tearing flesh to be swallowed

# Movement

**Hydrostatic skeletons** - A system of body support involving a body wall in tension surrounding a fluid or soft tissue under compression

**Endoskeletons** - Bony and/or cartilaginous structures within the body that provide support

**Exoskeletons** - A hard covering secreted on the outside of the body, used for body support, protection, and muscle attachment

- Animal locomotion provides an array of important functions
	- Finding food
	- Finding mates
	- Escaping from predators
	- Dispersing to new habitats

3 Types of Skeletal Systems
1) Hydrostatic skeletons
2) Endoskeletons
3) Exoskeletons

- Coordinated contractions and relaxations of different muscles in the body enable various shape changes and forms of locomotion
- Limbs help the diversity of movement
- They develop as out-pockets of the body wall and can take a variety of forms:
	- Lobe-like hydrostatic limbs of onychophorana
	- Joined limbs of arthropods and vertebrates
	- Lobe-like and bristled parapodia of segmented worms
	- Flexible hydrostatic tube feed of echinoderms
	- Arms and tentacles of mollusks

- Recent studies have shown that a gene, or *Dll*, that was originally discovered in fruit flies developed appendage growth
- *Dll* was involved in the initial phase of limb or appendage formation in animals
- Biologists conclude that all animal appendages have some degrees of genetic homology, even if the limbs themselves evolved independently in different lineages

# Reproduction

- Evolution by natural selection occurs when individuals with traits coded by certain alleles produce more surviving offspring than other individuals do

Diversification of Reproduction:
1) Asexual
2) Sexual
	1) External
	2) Internal


*Asexual or Sexual Reproduction?*

**Parthenogenesis** - A form of asexual reproduction in which offspring develop from unfertilized eggs

- In the phylum Rotifera, a lineage called the bdelloids reproduce only asexually through mitosis
- They produce diploid eggs that mature into adults without being fertilized; parthenogenesis
- Fission (splitting) in coral polyps
- Budding in cnidarian polyps called hydra
- Fish, lizards, and snail species can reproduce asexually
- Sexual reproduction via meiosis and fusion of gametes is the most common mode of reproduction in animals
- Asexual reproduction is more efficient than sexual reproduction, but has less genetic diversity, and survivability, and fitness
- Come animals, like coral polyps, can reproduce with either method

*Where Does Fertilization Occur?*

- During sexual reproduction, fertilization may be internal, usually within the body of the female
- The male inserts a sperm-transfer organ into the female

*Where Do Embryos Develop?*

- Eggs and embryos may be retained in the female's body during development, or fertilized eggs are laid outside the body

**Viviparous** - In animals, producing live young that develop within and are nourished by the body of the mother before birth, typically via a placenta

**Oviparous** - In animals, fertilized eggs outside the body, where they develop and hatch

**Ovoviviparous** - In animals, producing eggs that are retained inside the body (nourished by yolk) until they are ready to hatch

# Life Cycles

**Metamorphosis** - Transition from one developmental stage to another, such as from the larval to the adult form of an animal

**Larvae** - An immature stage of an animal species in which the immature and adult stage have different body forms

**Juveniles** - An individual that has adult like morphology but is not sexually mature

**Adults** - A sexually mature individual







# ==30.4 - Key Lineages of Animals: Non-Bilaterian Groups==

---

# Porifera (Sponges)

**Spicules** - Stiff spike of silica or calcium carbonate that provides structural support in the body of many sponges


# Ctenophora (Comb Jellies)





# Cnidaria (Jellyfish, Corals, Anemones, Hydroids)

**Cnidocyte** - A specialized stinging cell found in cnidarians (e.g. jellyfish, corals, and anemones) and used in capturing prey

**Polyp** - The immotile (sessile) stage in the life cycle of some cnidarians

**Medusa** - The free-floating stage in the life cycle of some snidarians
