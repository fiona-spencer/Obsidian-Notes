==26.1 - Why Do Biologists Study Bacteria and Archaea?==

---

Bacteria
- One of the three taxonomic domains of life, consisting of unicellular prokaryotes distinguished by cell walls composed largely of peptidoglycan, plasma membranes similar to those of eukaryotic cells, and ribosomes and RNA polymerase that differ from those in Achaea or Eukarya

Archaea
- One of the three taxonomic domains of life, consisting of unicellular prokaryotes distinguished by cell walls made of certain polysaccharides not found in bacterial or eukaryotic cell walls, plasma membranes composed of unique isoprene-containing phospholipids, and ribosomes and RNA polymerase similar to those of eukaryotes

Prokaryotic
- A member of the domain Bacteria or Archaea; a unicellular organism lacking a nucleus and containing relatively few organelles or cytoskeletal components

Eukarya
- One of the three taxonomic domains of life, consisting of unicellular organisms and multicellular organisms distinguished by a membrane-bound cell nucleus, numerous organelles, and an extensive cytoskeleton

Microbiome
- Community of microbes that naturally inhabit a specific environment (especially the community of microbes that live in or on part of the human body, such as the skin, mouth, gut, or other tissues)


3 Major Branches
1) Archaea
2) Bacteria
3) Eukarya

- All bacteria and archaea are unicellular, and prokaryotic (meaning they lack a membrane-bound nucleus)
- Eukaryotic organisms have cells with membrane-bound nuclei
- The prokaryotes that live on and in your body are part of a human microbiome
- The human microbiome can refer to the microbes that inhabit the whole body or parts of it, such as the mouth, gut, and other tissues
- A key difference between bacteria and archaea is the types of molecules that make up their plasma membranes and cell walls
- The machinery that bacteria and archaea use to process genetic information is also different
- DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, transcription-initiation proteins, and ribosomes found in archaea are more similar to those found in eukaryotes than those found eukaryotes than in bacteria

Features of Bacteria and Archaea


| Molecular Feature                                | Bacteria                                          | Archaea                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| RNA polymerase                                   | Just one type (consists of 5 subunits)            | Just one type (consists of 13 subunits)              |
| Peptidoglycan in call wall                       | Present                                           | Abset                                                |
| First amino acid incorporated during translation | Formylmethionine                                  | Methionine                                           |
| Histromes associated with DNA                    | Mo                                                | Yes                                                  |
| Plasma membrane                                  | Phospholipids tails made of a pair of fatty acids | Phospholipid tails made of a pair of isoprene chains |


- Antibiotics that poison bacterial ribosomes do not affect ribosomes of archaea or eukaryotes
- If all ribosome were identical, these antibiotics would kill the bacterial species and you

# Biological Impact
- The oldest fossil of any type found to date are 3.7-billion-year-old carbon-rich deposits derived from bacteria
- Eukaryotes appear in the fossil record 1.75 billion years ago
- Prokaryotes were the only form of life on Earth for nearly 2 billion years
- Most microbes are bacteria or archaea, that are unnamed and undescribed

**Microbes** - any microscopic organism, including bacteria, archaea, and various tiny eukaryotes

Abundance
- Trillions of prokaryotic cells can live on or within eukaryotes

	_Examples of microbe abundance:
	- Five cubic centimeters of good-quality soil contain billions of microbial cells, most are bacteria and archaea
	- The average human body is estimated to contain roughly 100 trillion bacteria and archaea cell
	- Biologists find these cells at concentrations of over 10000 individuals per mililitre in most of the world's oceans
	- Enormous numbers of bacterial and especially archaeal cells thrive inside rocks and sediments

Habitat Diversity
- Bacteria and archaea are found almost anywhere
	- Oxygen-free mud, hot springs, and salt flats

**Microbiology** - The field of study concerned with microscopic organisms

# Some Prokaryotes Thrive in Extreme Environments

- Bacteria or archaea that live in high-salt, high-temperatures, low-temperature, or high-pressure habitats are extremophiles
- Studying them has been important for the understanding of the tree of life, developing industrial applications, and exploring the structure and function of enzymes
- High temperature breaks non-covalent bonds holding macromolecules together, extreme heat usually denatures proteins, makes membranes weak, and separates the strands of the DNA double helix

**Extremophiles** - A bacterium or archaean that thrives in an "extreme" environment (eg. high slat, high temperature, low temperature, high pressure)

Bacteria and Archaea can grow:
- At a pH less than 1.0
- Water past boiling point
- At temperatures of 0 under Antarctic ice
- Water that is 5-10 times saltier than saltwater

Importance of extremophiles
- Extraterrestrial life
	- Extremophiles are model organisms in the search for extraterrestrial life
	- Cell-based life might be found in similar challenging environments
- Commercial applications
	- Enzymes that function at extreme temperatures and pressures are useful in industrial processes
	- _Taq_ polymerase (DNA polymerase that is table up to 95 degree) is used to run the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in research and commercial settings
	- This enzyme was from a bacterium called _Thermus aquatics_, discovered in a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park

Canadian Research: Planetary Research Scientist Darlene Lim Studies Extremophiles to Prepare for the Scientific Exploration of Mars

**Stromatolites** - Sedimentary rock formed by the action of cyanobacteria

**Microbialites** - Simpler structure similar to ancient stromatolites

- Cyanobacteria were the first living things to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis
- Evidence of ancient cyanobacteria can be found in stromatolites, sedimentary rocks formed by the action of cyanobacteria
- Stromatolites formed underwater as sediment was trapped in a mucus layer secreted by mats of cyanobacteria
- Cyanobacteria continues to reproduced on the upper surface of the mats, as these bacteria cells are dependent on light for photosyntheses
- Over time, the sediment solidified as rock, which grew as sediment continued to accumulate in new layers
- The relationship between cyanobacteria and stromatolites is confirmed by the presence of cyanobacteria or their fossilized remains in modern and some ancient stromatolites
- The oldest stromatolites are about 3.5 billion years old
- Stromatolites remained abundant throughout the Precambrian, but declined 540 million years ago, as a result of the grazing by early animals
- Modern stromatolites are rare
- In Pavilion Lake, cyanobacteria form microbialites, simpler structures similar to ancient stromatolites
- SUBSEA (Systematic Underwater Biochemical Science and Exploration Analog), explores deep sea volcanic seamounts, gaining insight into exploration of the solar system and the Earth's oceans

# Medical Importance

**Pathogens** - Any entity capable of causing disease, such as a microbe, virus, or prion

- The first paper documenting that an archaeal species was associated with a human disease (dental condition called periodontitis) was publishes in 2004
- Bacteria can disrupt normal body function enough to cause illness
- Many species protect their host from bacteria that cause disease
- Bacteria that cause disease are pathogens
- Pathogenic bacteria have been responsible for some of the most devastating epidemics in human history

- Pathogenic forms come from several different taxa
- Pathogenic bacteria tend to affect tissues at the entry point to the body, such as wounds or pores in the skin, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and the urogenital canal

# Koch's Postulates
- Robert Koch was the first person to establish a link between a particular species of bacterium and a specific disease
- Louis Pasteur has shown that bacteria and other micro-organisms are responsible for spoiling milk, wine, broth, and other foods
- Koch hypothesized that bacteria might also be responsible for causing infectious disease, which spread by being passed from an infected individual to an uninfected individual
- Koch tested the hypothesis by identifying the organism that causes anthrax, a disease of cattle and other grazing mammals that can result in fatal blood poisoning

Koch's 4 Postulates
1) The microbe must be present in individuals suffering from the disease and absent from healthy individuals
	1) In some cases, infectious microbes could be present in an individual who was nearly or completely free of signs of disease
2) The organism must be isolated and grown in a pure culture away from the host organism
3) If organisms from the pure culture are injected into a healthy experimental animal, the disease symptoms should appear
4) The organism should be isolated from the disease experimental animal, again grown in pure culture, and demonstrated by its size, shape, and colour to be the same as the original organism

**Koch's postulates** - four criteria used to determine whether a suspected infectious agent causes a particular disease

- Koch's postulates are used in modified form to confirm a causative link between new diseases and a suspected infectious agent
- Microbiologists now recognize that many bacteria cannot be grown in culture, so they use other means of detection for those organisms, such as DNA sequence-based identification

# The Germ Theory

**Germ theory of disease** - the theory that infectious diseases are caused by bacteria, viruses, and other microbes

**Infectious diseases** - Disease caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites that can be transmitted from one organism to another or acquired from the environment

- Koch's experimental results were the first test of the germ theory of disease, which states that infectious diseases are caused by specific microbes in the body
	- Bacteria
	- Archaea
	- Viruses
- Viruses are acellular particles that propagate by sabotaging the genetic machinery of cells

- Infectious diseases are spread in 3 main ways
1) Person to person
2) Transmitted by bites from insects or other animals
3) Acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water, or by being exposed to microbes in the surrounding environment

- The germ theory of disease laid the foundation for modern medicine
- During the American Civil War, more soldiers died of bacterial infections contracted from drinking contaminated water with human feces than died of wounds from battle
- The vast majority of infectious disease before antibiotics was the introduction of improved nutrition and sanitation

What Makes Some Bacterial Cell Pathogenic?

**Virulence** - The ability of a pathogen to cause severe disease in a susceptible host

**Toxin** - A poison produced by a living organism, such as a plant, animal, or micro-organism

- Virulence, or the ability to cause disease, is a heritable trait that varies among individuals in a population
- The genome of the pathogenic strain of _E. coli_ is slightly larger because is has acquired virulence genes, including one coding for a protein toxin
- After entering a host cell, this toxin binds to ribosomes and inhibits protein synthesis, killing the host cell
- Only host-cell protein synthesis is blocked by toxin
- Cells lining the blood vessels near the host's intestinal epithelium are most affected by the toxin, and the resulting damage leads to bloody diarrhea and possible death
- Pathogenic bacteria are likely to infect many new hosts

Some Pathogenic Bacteria Produce Resistant Endospores

**Endospores** - A tough, resistant reproductive structure formed in certain bacteria in response to poor environmental conditions

- Endospores are tough, thick-walled, dormant structures formed during times of environmental stress, often in response to a lack of nutrients
- Endospores contain a copy of the cell's DNA, RNA, ribosomes, and essential enzymes that become surrounded by a tough, resistant wall
- Once walled off from the surrounding cell, metabolic activity within the endospore stops and the rest of the original cell breaks down
- Endospores are resistant to high temperatures, UV radiation, and antibiotics
- When conditions becomes favourable, endospores resume growth as normal, actively dividing cells
- Bacterial endospores involved in transmitting diseases to humans:
	- Tentanus
	- Gangrene
	- Botulism
	- Anthrax (inhalation, and cutaneous)

The Past, Present, and Future of Antibiotics

**Antibiotics** - Any substance, such as penicillin, that can kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria

**Biofilms** - A complex community of bacteria enmeshed in a polysaccharide-rich, extracellular matrix that allows the bacteria to attach to a surface

- Antibiotics are small organic molecules that kill bacteria or stop them from growing
- Many re produced naturally by a wide array of soil-dwelling bacteria and fungi
- Antibiotics are hypothesized to help cells reduce competition for nutrients and other resources
- Extensive use of antibiotics in the late twentieth century in clients and animal feed led to the evolution of drug-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria
- Bacteria grows as biofilms, dense bacterial colonies enmeshed in a polysaccharide-rich matrix that helps shields the bacteria from antibiotics
- Antibiotic-resistant biofilms on medical devices such as catheters are a growing problem in hospitals
- Biofilms grow on surfaces such as phone touchscreens, plastic food containers, and teen

# Role in Bioremediation

Bioremediation - The use of living organisms, usually bacteria or archaea, to degrade environmental pollutants

- Serious pollutants are highly hydrophobic and accumulate in sediments
- Compounds are then ingested by worms or other organisms, that can be passed along to other customers
- At moderate to high concentrations, these pollutants are toxic to eukaryotes
- Petroleum from oil spills and compounds that contain ring structures and chlorine atoms, such as the family of compounds called dioxins, are particularly toxic to humans

2 Complementary Bioremediation Strategies
1) Fertilizing contaminated sites to encourage the growth of existing prokaryotes that degrade toxic compounds ("bio-stimulation")
	- Bacteria and archaea that use hydrocarbons in cellular respiration use the nitrogen in Nitrogen-containing compounds in oil spills to synthesize enzymes and other key compounds
	- Oil was broken down more quickly in these fertilized sediments
2) "Seeding," or adding, specific species of bacteria and archaea to contaminated sites
	- Bacteria that are able to render harmless certain chlorinated compounds, such as polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) as election accepters during cellular respiration
	- By-product is dechlorinated and nontoxic to humans and other eukaryotes
	- Seeding works best if the seeded microbes are able to tolerate the environmental condition of the bioremediation site


==26.2 - How Do Biologists Study Bacteria and Archaea?==

# Using Enrichment Cultures

**Enrichment** **culture** - A method of detecting and obtaining cells with specific characteristic by placing a sample, containing many types of cells, under a specific set of conditions and isolating those cells that grow rapidly in response

**Thermophiles** - A bacterium or archaean that thrives in very hot environments

- Enrichment culture is a method of detecting and obtaining cells with specific characteristics by placing a sample, containing many types of cells, under a specific set of conditions and isolating those cells that grow rapidly in response
	- Temperature
	- Salt concentration
	- Lighting
	- Substrate
	- Available nutrients
- Cells that thrive under the specified conditions increase in numbers enough to be isolated and studied in detail
- Most eukaryotes use sugars as electron donors and oxygen as an electron acceptor during cellular respiration
- Ferric ions (the oxidized form of iron) are abundant in the deep rocks, in the form of ferric oxyhydroxides, $FE(OH)_3$
- Researchers predicted that if an organism in the samples reduced the ferric ions during cellular respiration, then a black, oxidized, and magnetic mineral called magnetite ($FE_3O_4$) would start appearing in the cultures as a by-product of cellular respiration
- This discovery demonstrates that Earth's crust contained many organisms
- At least one bacterial species that can live deep below Earth's surface grew in this enrichment culture
- Different culture conditions might result in the enrichment of different species present in the same sample

# Using Metagenomics

**Metagenomics/environmental sequencing** - The inventory of all the genes in a community or ecosystem created by sequencing, analyzing, and comparing the genomes of the component organisms
- Often refers to the study of microbial communities

- Less than 1% of prokaryotic species living today have been grow in culture
- Based on extracting and sequencing much of the DNA from an environmental sample that contains numerous unknown species
- Gene present in the community are identified by comparing the DNA sequences with those of known gene
- Undiscovered species, genes, and biochemical pathways can be characterized

Summary of Metagenomics Study:
1. Collect samples from an environment containing a mixed community of unknown organisms and extract the DNA
2. Generate small DNA fragments and sequence as many as possible
3. Compare these sequences with those of known genes
	1. This information can be used to identify species and to investigate biological processes

Direct sequencing - A technique for identifying and studying micro-organisms that cannot be grown in culture
- Involved detecting and amplifying copies of specific genes in the micro-organisms' DNA, sequencing these genes, and then comparing the sequences with the known sequences from other organisms

- In combination with direct sequencing, a technique based on isolating and sequencing a specific gene from organisms found in a particular habitat, metagenomics is revolutionizing biologists understanding of prokaryotic diversity


# Investigating the Human Microbiome

**Microbiome** - Community of microbes that naturally inhabit a specific environment (especially the community of microbes that live in or on parts of the human body, such as the skin, mouth, gut, or other tissues)

Major Groups of Prokaryotes found in the Human Body:
1) Actinobacteria
2) Firmicutes
3) Bacteroidetes
4) Fusebacteria
5) Cyanobacteria
6) Proteobacteria

- Bacteria play important roles in human physiology, including digestion of complex carbohydrates and synthesis of essential amino acids and vitamins
- Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked to both inflammatory bowel disease and obesity

# Evaluating Molecular Phylogenies

**Tree of life** - The phylogenetic tree that includes all organisms

- Some of the most useful phylogenetic trees for the Bacteria and the Archaea have been based on studies of the RNA molecule found in the small subunits of ribosomes, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in prokaryotes and 18S rRNA in eukaryotes
- The _tree of life_ forms the framework of the polygeny of bacteria and archaea an includes all organisms

![[Pasted image 20250311131909.png|400]]

- Before the publication, biologists thought that the major division among organisms was between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
- Based on rRNA molecules, the major division of live-forms were acknowledged to be Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya
- Lateral gene transfer has blurred the boundaries of the domains
- In 1980s, a suggestion that the tree of life is two domains representing Bacteria and Eukarya is a result from whole-genome sequencing
- In 2014, another group of researchers argued Archaea form the root of the tree, with Bacteria, and Eukarya more closely related to each other


**Monophyletic groups** - An evolutionary unit that includes an ancestral population and all of its descendants but no others
- Also called a clade of lineage


==26.3 - What Themes Occur in the Diversification of Bacteria and Archaea?==

---

# 3 Themes in Diversification
1) Genetic variation through gene transfer
2) Morphology
3) Metabolism

#  Genetic Variation Through Gene Transfer

**Binary fission** - The process of cell division used for asexual reproduction of many prokaryotic cells
- The genetic material is replicated an partitioned to opposite sides of a growing cell, which then divides in half, creating two genetically identical cells

- Lateral gene transfer is central to the evolution of bacteria and archaea
- Prokaryotes can acquire a diversity of traits that is not available during binary fission
- Binary fission is the process of cell division used for asexual reproduction of many prokaryotes cells


3 Way Gene Transfer Occurs
1) Transformation 
	- Bacteria or archaea naturally take up DNA from the environment that has been released by cell lysis or secreted

2) Transduction
	- Viruses pick up DNA from one prokaryotic cell and transfer it to another cell

3) Conjugation
	- Genetic information is transferred by direct cell-to-cell contact


![[Pasted image 20250311135137.png]]

- Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes occurs when haploid cells the are formed by meiosis combine to form a new diploid individual
- Sexual reproduction does not exist in prokaryotes
- Bacteria and archaea are haploid through their lives and do not undergo meiosis

**Plasmid** - A small, usually circular, supercoiled DNA molecule independent of the cell's main chromosome(s) in prokaryotes and some eukaryotes

- Genes can move from one individual to another via conjugation
- Conjugation takes place when a physical connection, called a conjugation tube, forms between two prokaryotic cells
- After conjugation plasmid transfer occurs where a small circular piece of DNA called a plasmid is copied in one cell and transferred to the other cell
- Plasmids often contain accessory genes that are not required for normal growth, but can be advantageous to the bacterium
	- Genes responsible for antibiotic resistance

![[Pasted image 20250311135338.png]]

- Conjugation can also result in genetic recombination
- Plasmid that has become integrates into the main bacterial chromosomes is copied and transferred, along with genes from the main bacterial chromosomes, through the conjugation tube to a recipient cell
- Transferred portion of chromosome replaces the homologous portion in the recipient cell's, resulting in a new combination of alleles on the chromosomes

Bacterial "Sex"
1) One-way transfer of genetic material instead of an exchange between individuals
2) Instead of involving all the genes present, the transfer is limited to a plasmid or a small portion of the genes in the main chromosome

# Morphological Diversity

Bacterial Size, Shape, and Motility
- Size
	- Bacteria cells range in size from smallest of all free-living cells, bacteria called mycoplasmas with volumes as small as 0.15u$m^3$ to the largest bacterium known
- Shape and arrangement
	- Bacterial cells range in shape from filaments, spheres, rods, and chains to spirals
	- Often arranged in chains (strep arrangement) or clusters (staph arrangement)
- Motility
	- While most bacteria cells are mobile, many species are also motile
	- Swimming occurs when cells rotate one or more flagella
	- Bacterial flagella spin like a propeller


![[Pasted image 20250317102806.png]]


Cell-Wall Composition
- Archaea have unique phospholipids in their plasma membranes
	- The hydrocarbon tails of the phospholipids are made from isoprene
- Bacteria have a unique compound called peptidoglycan in their cell walls

 **Gram strain** - A dye that distinguishes the two general types of cells walls found in bacteria
- Used to routinely classify bacteria as Gram-negative (pink) or Gram-positive (purple)


- Gram-positive
	- Bacteria that look purple when treated with a Gram stain
	- These bacteria have cell walls composed of a thick layer of peptidoglycan and no outer phospholipid layer
- Gram-negative
	- Bacteria that look pink when treated with a Gram stain
	- These bacteria have a cell wall composed of a thin layer of peptidoglycan and an outer phospholipid bilayer

- Gram-positive cells may respond to treatment by penicilin-like drugs that disrupt peptidoglycan synthesis
- Gram-negative cells are more likely to be affected by erythromycin or other types of drugs that poison bacterial ribosomes

![[Pasted image 20250312114224.png]]

# Metabolic Diversity
- Bacteria and archaea can subsist on almost anything
- Organisms have two fundamental nutritional needs
	- Chemical energy as ATP
	- Molecules with carbon-carbon bonds that ares used for the synthesis of fatty acids, proteins, DNA, RNA, and other large, complex compounds

Bacteria and archaea produce ATP in 3 ways:
1. Phototrophs ("light feeders")
	 - Use light energy to promote electrons to the top of electron transport chains
	 - ATP is produced by photophosphorylation

2. Chemoorganotrophs ("chemical carbon feeders")
	- Oxidize organic molecules with high potential energy, such as sugars
	- ATP may be produced by cellular respiration, with sugars serving as electrons donors or via fermentation pathways

3. Chemolithotrophs ("chemical rock feeders")
	- Oxidize inorganic molecules with high potential energy, such as ammonia or hydrogen sulfides
	- ATP is produced by cellular respiration, with organic compounds serving as the electron donor


Obtaining Building-block compounds with C-C bonds in 2 ways:
1. Autotrophs ("self feeders")
	- Synthesize their own compounds from simple starting materials, such as CO2 and methane

2. Heterotrophs ("other feeders")
	- Absorb ready-to-use organic compounds, called building compounds produced by other organisms in their environment

- Therefore there are 6 method for producing ATP and obtaining carbon
- Named the six "feeding strategies"


6 General Method for Obtaining Energy and C-C Bonds
![[Pasted image 20250311192231.png]]

- Many species of bacteria and archaea observe all 6 feeding strategies
- Certain species can switch among modes of living, depending on environmental conditions
- Eukaryotes are simple in their metabolism compared with bacteria and archaea
- The basic chemistry required for photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and fermentation originated in Bacteria and Archaea
- The evolution of variation on each of these processes allowed prokaryotes to diversify into millions of species


Producing ATP through Cellular Respiration: Variation in Electron Donors and Acceptors
- Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic species are chemoorganotrophs
- Obtain energy required to make ATP by breaking down organic compounds such as sugars, starch, or fatty acids
- During cellular respiration enzymes strip electrons from organic molecules that have high potential energy and then transfer these high-energy electrons to the electron carriers NADH and FADH2
- These compounds feed electrons to an electron transport chain (ETC), where electrons are stepped down from a high-energy state to a low-energy state
-  The resulting flow of protons through the enzyme ATP synthase result in the production of ATP, via the process called chemiomosis
- In Eukaryotic cells, the ETC is located in the highly folded inner mitochondrial membrane
- In bacteria and archaea, the ETC is located in the plasma membrane

![[Pasted image 20250311194823.png]]

Cellular respiration by most eukaryotes and prokaryotes
- Organic compounds with high potential energy, often glucose, serve as the original electron donor
- When cellular respiration is complete, glucose is completely oxidixed to CO2, which is a by-product
- Oxygen is the final electron acceptor, and water is also produced as a by-product

- This kind of cellular respiration is called aerobic, because oxygen is used as the final electron acceptor
- Many prokaryotes use an electron donor other than sugars and an electron acceptor other than oxygen during cellular respiration
- These species produce by-products other than carbon dioxide and water
	- Molecules with high potential energy serve as electron donors
		- Hydrogen molecules
		- Hydrogen sulfides
		- Ammonia
		- Methane
	- Compounds with relatively low potential energy as electron acceptors
		- Sulfate
		- Nitrate
		- Carbon dioxide
		- Ferric ions


- Prokaryotes can use almost any compound with high/low potential energy as electron donors/acceptors
- The diverse metabolic helps with cleaning up pollution
- Species that use organic solvents or petroleum-based fuels as electron donors/acceptors may excrete waste products that are less toxic than the original compounds


Producing ATP Via Fermentation: Variation in Substrates

**Fermentation** - Fermentation is any several metabolic pathways in the cytosol that regenerate oxidizing agents, such as NAD+, by transferring electrons to an electron acceptor in the absence of an electron transport chain

- Allowing pathways such as glycolysis to continue making ATP
- Since fermentation is a less efficient way to produce ATP, species use it as an alternative metabolic strategy when no electron acceptors are available to make cellular respiration possible
- In other species, fermentation does not occur at all, in some, fermentation is the only way the cell make ATP

Prokaryotes that produce ATP via fermentation use a wide variety of substrates
- Species of _Clostridium_
	- Ferment complex carbohydrates (including cellular or starch), proteins, purines, or amino acids
	- Species that ferment amino acids produce by-products with names such as cadaverine and putrescine
- Other bacteria that can ferment lactose
	- This fermentation has two end products
		- Propionic acid and CO2


Producing ATP Via Photophosphorylation: Variation in Electron Sources and Pigments

**Photophosphorylation**- Production of ATP molecules by ATP synthase using the proton gradient generated either:
1) As light-excited electrons flow through an electron transport chain during photosynthesis
2) as rhodospin-like molecules in some bacteria or archaea absorb light to pump protons across their plasma membranes to create a chemiosmotic gradient

3 Ways of Photophosphorylation in Bacteria and Archaea:
1. Light activates a pigment called bacteriorhodopsin or archaerhodopsin, which uses the abosorbed energy to transport protons across the plasma membrane and out of the cell
	- The resulting flow of protons back into the cell drives the synthesis of ATP via chemiosmosis
2. Bacterium that lives near hydrothermal vents performs photosynthesis not by absorbing sunlight, but by absorbing faint light from geothermal radiation
3. Pigments that absorb light raise electrons to high-energy states
	- Electrons are stepped down to lower-energy states by electron transport chains, the energy released is used to generate ATP


**Photosynthesis** - The complex biological process that converts light energy to chemical energy stored in the carbohydrate G3P

**Oxygenic** - Referring to any process or reaction the produces oxygen
- Species that use water as a source of electrons for photosynthesis

**Anoxygenic** - Referring to any process or reaction that does no produce oxygen


Obtaining Building-Block Compounds: Variation in Pathways for Fixing Carbon

 - In autotrophs, including plants, the enzymes of the Calvin cycle transform $CO_2$ into organic molecules that an be used in synthesizing cell material
 - Heterotrophs, animals and fungi, obtain carbon from living plants or animals by absorbing the organic compounds released as dead tissues decay
 - Prokaryotes pursue the same two strategies: autotrophy and heterotrophy

Other Biochemical Pathways
1) Methanotrophs ("methane eaters")
	- Use methane as their carbon source
	- Process methane into more complex organic compound via one of two enzymatic pathways, depending on species
2) Methanogens ("methan producers")
	- Produce methane as a by-product of cellular respiration
	- The formation of methane in the guts of humans and other large mammals



# Ecological Diversity and Global Impacts
- The array of electron donors, electron acceptors, and fermentation substrates bacteria and archaea exploit allows heterotrophic prokaryotes to live almost anywhere
- The evolution of 3 types of photophosphorylation, based on bacteriorhodospin or archaerhodospin, geothermal energy, or pigments that donate high-energy electron to ETCs extends the types of habitats that support phototrophic prokaryotes


The Oxygen Revolution
- Oxygen represent almost 21% of the molecules in Earth's atmosphere
- No free molecular oxygen existed for the first 2.3 billion years of Earth
- This is based on 2 observations
	1) No plausible source of oxygen at the time the planet formed
	2) Chemical analysis of the oldest Earth rocks suggests that they forms in the absence of atmospheric oxygen

- Early Earth was dominated by nitrogen and carbon dioxide

Cyanobacteria - A lineage of photosynthetic bacteria; likely the first life forms to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis

- Cyanobacteria became numerous in oceans about 2.7 - 2.5 billion year ago
- Oxygen concentrations in the oceans and atmosphere began to increase 2.3 - 2.1 billion years ago
- With oxygen, cells began to use it as the final electron acceptor during cellular respiration
- Aerobic respiration was now possible, instead of only anaerobic respiration
- When oxygen was available, then, cells could produce much more ATP for each electron donated by NADH or FADH2
- The rate of energy production rose dramatically
- The presence of oxygen allowed formation of the ozone layer, which protected Earth's surface from UV radiation, making evolution of life on land possible

Nitrogen Fixation and the Nitrogen Cycle
- Organisms must have nitrogen to synthesize proteins and nucleic acids
- Most organisms cannot use molecular nitrogen because of the strong triple bond linking the nitrogen atoms
- All eukaryotes and many prokaryotes have to obtain N in a form such as ammonia or nitrate

**Nitrogen fixation** - The incorporation of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which can be used to make many organic compounds

- Bacteria and archaea are capable of converting nitrogen to ammonia via nitrogen fixation
- It is a complex and highly endergonic reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction
- The key enzyme that catalyzes the reaction, nitrogenase, is found in only a few phyla of bacteria and archaea
- Important relationship to plants
	- Species of cyanobacteria live in association with a water fern that grows in rice paddies and helps fertilize the rice plants
	- In terrestrial environment, nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in close association with legumes, and take place in special root structures called nodules

**Nitrogen cycle** - The movement of nitrogen among terrestrial ecosystems, the oceans, and the atmosphere

- When exposed to $O_2$, nitrogenase is irreversibly poisoned and degraded
- The only organisms with the nitrogenase gene are those that live in anaerobic habitats or are able to protect the enzyme from oxygen
- Nitrate that some bacteria produce can be converted into molecular nitrate when oxidized
- This can be futhur converted into molecular nitrogen
- Bacteria and archaea are responsible for driving the movement of nitrogen atoms through ecosystems around the globe through the nitrogen cycle

Nitrate Pollultion
- Most crop plants do not live in association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria
- To yield crops, farmers use fertilizers that are high in nitrogen
- Massive additions of nitrogen in the form of ammonia are causing pollution problems

Pollution in the Gulf of Mexico
1. Most of the ammonia added to corn fields are not absorbed
2. Prokaryotes in the soil use the ammonia as food
	1. Microbes use this to fuel cellular respiration and release nitrite
	2. Other microbes use nitrite and release nitrate
3. Nitrate are soluble in water and are washed out of soils into groundwater
4. Nitrates are used by cyanobacteria and algae, the population of these organisms "blooms" in response
5. When organisms dies and sink, bacteria and archaea and other decomposers use them as food
	1. The decomposers use oxygen in cellular respiration
6. Oxygen levels decline in the water, producing an anoxic "dead zone"
	1. Decreases the number of fish, shrimp, and other organisms that require oxygen


==26.4 - Key Lineages of Bacteria and Archaea==

---

# The Tree of Life
- Two bacterial branches, the ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts, join the domain Eukarya in different locations near the base
- The endosymbiotic origins for the two eukaryotic organelles show that they branched from the Bacteria domain and obtained new genetic material
- As a result of lateral gene transfer, photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation are scattered among bacterial lineages
- Other genes, such as drug resistance and pathogen virulence, show similarly patch distribution among prokaryotic lineages
- Lateral gene transfer between prokaryotic cells is common, and much of the genomic variation may be due to gene transfer and gene loss

# Bacteria
- The name bacteria comes from the Greek root *bacter*, meaning "rod" or "staff"
- There are at least 29 lineages, or phyla, of bacteria
- Some are classified by distinct morphological, metabolic, or phylogenetic analyses of gene sequence data

![[Pasted image 20250317113156.png]]

Actinobacteria
- Filamentous, forming branching chains
- Species in the genus *Streptomyces* and *Arthrobacter* are abundant in soil and are important decomposers of dead plants and animal material
- Some species live in association with plant roots and fix nitrogen, others can break down toxins, such as herbicides, nicotine, and caffeine
- Distinct anti-microbial compounds are actively prescribed to treat diseases in humans or livestock

Chlamydiae

Endosymbionts - An organism that lives in a symbiotic relationship instead the body of its host

- Least diverse of all major bacterial lineages
- Spherical and small
- Live as parasitic endosymbionts

Cyanobacteria
- Photosynthetic bacteria are found as independent cells, in chains that form filaments, or in loose aggregations of individual cells called colonies
- The most abundant organisms of Earth
- Produce oxygen, nitrogen, and organic compounds that feed organisms living in the surface waters of freshwater and marine environments

Firmicutes
- Extremely common in animal intestines, were they live as mutualists that aid the digestive process
- Several species play useful roles in agriculture and food processing
- Other cause a variety of human diseases

Proteobacteria

Fruiting bodies - A structure in some prokaryotes, fungi, and protists for spore dispersal; usually consists of a base, a stalk, and a mass of spores at the top

- Names after the Greek god Proteus, who could assume many shapes
- Some species form stalked cells while others form aggregates of cells organized as spore-forming fruiting bodies
- Some species cause disease
- Others play key roles in the cycle of nitrogen atoms through terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems

Spirochaetes
- Distinguished by their unique corkscrew shape and flagella
- A spirochete's flagella are contained within a structure called the outer sheath, which surround the cell
- Parasitic, disease-causing species are propelled by this motion into tissues of their host
- Other species are common in freshwater and marine habitats
- One species is found only in the hindgut of termites, where it fixes nitrogen

# Archaea
- Comes from the Greek root *archae*, for "ancient"
- Inspired by the hypothesis that this is a ancient group
- Recent phylogenies based on DNA sequence data indicate that the domain is composed of several major phyla

![[Pasted image 20250317113432.png]]

Crenarchaeota
- Are also called eocytes
- Found in harsh environments, including the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park
- Thrive in hot, acidic, and high-pressure environments

Euryarchaeota
- The root *eury* means "board"
- Live in every conceivable habitat
- Some species are adapted to high-salt habitats with pH 11.5
- Other species are adapted to acidic condition with a pH as low as 0

Thaumarchaeota
- More recently recognized lineages
- Abundant in oceans, estuaries, and terrestrial soil
- Unlike extremophiles, this lineage are considered mesophilic "middle loving" because they grow best at moderate temperatures
