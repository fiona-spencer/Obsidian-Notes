Green algae - A paraphyletic group of photosynthetic organisms that contain chloroplasts similar to those in land plants. Often classified as protists, green algae are the closest living relatives of land plants and form a monophyletic group with them

Land plants - A monophyletic group of organisms that contain chloroplasts similar to those in green algae. The vase majority of land plants are photosynthetic and live in terrestrial habitats. Includes mosses, hornworts, liverworts, and all vascular plants

# Plants Provides Ecosystem Services

Ecosystem - All the organisms that live in a geographic area, together with the nonliving (abiotic) components that affect or exchange material with the organisms; a community and its physical environment


Plant Produce Oxygen

Ecosystem - All of the benefits that human s derive, directly or indirectly, from ecosystem functions
