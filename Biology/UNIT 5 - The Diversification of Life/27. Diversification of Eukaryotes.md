- The third domain on the tree of life: The Eukarya
	- Consisting of unicellular organisms and multicellular organisms distinguished by a membrane-bound cell nucleus, numerous organelles, and an extensive cytoskeleton

Fundamental Features of Eukaryotes
1. Larger, have more organelles, and more extensive cytoskeleton
2. The nuclear envelope is a unique
3. All eukaryotes posses mitochondria or the molecular remnants of former mitochondria
4. Multicellularity is rata in bacteria and unknown in archaea, but has evolved multiple times in eurkaryotes
5. Bacteria and archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, while eukaryotes reproduces asexually or sexually with meiotic cell division

- Key morphological innovations of eukaryotes
	- Nuclear envelope
	- Mitochondria
	- Chloroplasts

**Binary fission** - the process of cell division used for asexual reproduction of many prokaryotic cells. The genetic material is replicated and partitioned to opposite sides of a growing cell, which then divides in half, creating two genetically identical cells

**Protists** - any eukaryote that is not a land plant, animal, or fungus. Protists are a diverse paraphyletic group. Most are unicellular, but some are multicellular or form aggregations called colonies

- Protists have no defining feature that is found only in protists and in no other organisms
- They do not form a naturally occurring unified group

- The common feature among protists is that they tend to live in environments where they are surrounded by water most of the time
- Most plants and fungi, and many animals, are terrestrial

- 3 reasons biologists study protists
	1) Important medically
	2) Important ecologically
	3) Key to understanding the evolution of plants, fungi, and animals

# Impacts on Human Health and Welfare
- The Irish potato famine was caused by *Phytophthora infestans* a protists called water moulds

Malaria
- 4 major infectious disease
	1. Tuberculosis (bacteria)
	2. COVID-19 (virus)
	3. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
	4. Malaria (protist)


- Malaria ranks as the world's worst infectious disease

# Ecological Importance of Protists

Protists Play a Key Role in Aquatic Food Chains

Primary producers - any organisms that creates its own food by photosynthesis from reduced inorganic compounds and that is a food source for other species in its ecosystem; also called autotroph

Phytoplankton - photosynthetic organisms within plankton

Food chain - a relatively simple pathway of energy flow through a few species, each at a different trophic level, in an ecosystem. Might include, for example, a primary producer, a primary consumer, a secondary consumer, and a decomposer

Carbon sink - a reservoir that stores carbon-containing compounds for an indefinite period of time

Synapomorphy - A shared, derived trait found in two or more taxa that is present in their most recent common ancestor but is missing in more distant ancestors. Useful for inferring evolutionary relationships

Monophyletic groups - An evolutionary unit that includes an ancestral population and all of its descendants but no others. Also called a clade of lineage

Paraphyletic group - A group that includes an ancestral population and some but not all of its descendants

# Microscopy: Studying Cell Structure

Flagellum - A long, cellular projection that undulates (eukaryotes) or rotates (in prokaryotes) to move the cell through an aqueous environment

# Evaluating Molecular Phylogenies

# Discovering New Lineages via Direct Sequencing

Direct sequencing - a technique for identifying and studying microorganisms that cannot be grown in culture. Involved detecting and amplifying copies of specific genes in the microorganisms' DNA, sequencing these genes, and then comparing the sequences with the known sequences from other organisms

Picoplankton - Plankton cells that are between 0.2 and 2.0 microns in diameters

# 27.3 - What Themes Occur in the Diversification of Protists?

What Morphological Innovations Evolved in Protists?

Endosymbiosis and the Origin of Mitochondria

Endosymbiosis theory - The theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from prokaryotes that were engulfed by host cells and took up a symbiotic existence within those cells, a process termed primary endosymbiosis. In some eukaryotes, chloroplasts may have originated by secondary endosymbiosis; that is, when a cell engulfed a chloroplast-containing protists and retained its chloroplasts

Symbiosis - Any close and prolonged physical relationship between individuals of two different species

Endosymbiosis - An association between organisms of two different species in which one lives inside the cell or cells of the other

Lateral gene transfer - Transfer of DNA between two different species

Endosymbiosis and the Origin of Chloroplasts

The Nuclear Envelope

Structures for Support and Protection

Multicellularity

Multicellularity - The state of being composed of many cells that adhere to each other and do not all express the same genes, resulting in some cells having specialized functions

# How Do Protists Obtain Food?

Phagocytosis - Uptake by a cell of small particles or cells by invagination and pinching off of the plasma membrane to form small, membrane-bound vesicles; one type of endocytosis

Ingestie Feeding

Absorptive Feeding

Decomposers - An organism whose diet consist mainly of dead organic matter (detritus). Various bacteria, fungi, protists, and animals are detrivores


Detritus - A layer of dead organic matter that accumulates at ground level or on seafloors and lake bottoms


Parasite - An organism that lives on a host species (ectoparasite) or in a host species (endoparasite) and that damages its host



Photosynthesis


# How Do Protists Move?

Ameboid motion - A sliding movement observed in some protists accomplished by the formation of cytoplasmic extensions of the ell called pseudopodia; one form of cell crawling


# How Do Protists Reproduce?

Sexual versus Asexual Reproduction

# Life Cycles - Haploid vs. Diploid Dominated

Fertilization - Fusion of the nuclei of two gametes (often haploid) to form a zygote with a nucleus (often diploid). Exceptions to the haploid and diploid rule are seen in polyploid species

Life Cycles - Alteration of Generations

Alteration of generations - A life cycle involving alteration of a multicellular haploid stage (gametophyte) with a multicellular diploid stage (sporophyte). Occurs in most plants and some protists

Gametophyte - In organisms undergoing alteration of generations, the multicellular haploid form that arises from a single haploid spore and produces gametes by mitosis and cell division

Sporophyte - In organisms undergoing alteration of generation, the multicellular diploid form that develops by mitotic divisions after fertilization produces a zygote

Spore - In bacteria, a dormant form that generally is resistant to extreme conditions. In eukaryotes, a single haploid cell produced by meiosis; it is distinct from a gamete, however, in being able to grow in a multicellular, haploid organism through mitotic divisions directly (no fertilization required)
