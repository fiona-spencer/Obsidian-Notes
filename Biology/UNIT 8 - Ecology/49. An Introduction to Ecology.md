**Ecology** - The study of how organisms interact with each other and with their surrounding environments

- Organisms interact with each other and the nonliving environment in complex ecological systems
- German biologist Ernst Haeckel first defined "oekologie" less than a decade after Charles Darwin published _On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_ in 1859
- Evolution and ecology are intertwined and codependent
- The diversity of life on Earth is the result of evolutionary processes that played out in a changing ecological context
- Ecologists work in sub-disciplines ranging from ecological developmental biology to physiological ecology and conservation genetics
- Environments are changing more rapidly now than ever
- Humans are causing widespread habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduction of exotic organisms, and climate change


# ==49.1 - Levels of Ecological Study==

---

5 Main Levels of Ecology
1) Organisms
2) Populations
3) Communities
4) Ecosystems
5) Biosphere

- Levels are not rigid or exclusive

Ex. Sockeye salmon

1) Organismal
	1) Salmons migrate from saltwater to freshwater environments to breed
2) Population
	1) Each female salmon produced thousands of eggs
	2) On average, only a few offspring will survive to return to the same stream to breed
3) Community
	1) Salmon are prey as well as predators
4) Ecosystem
	1) Salmon die and then decompose, releasing nutrients that are used by other organisms
5) Global
	1) Worldwide populations of salmon are affected by changes in water flow and temperature due to global climate change


# Organismal Ecology

**Adaptations** - Any heritable trait increases the fitness of an individual with that trait, compared with individuals without that trait, in a particular environment

- At the organismal level, researchers explore morphological, physiological, and behavioural adaptations
	- Heritable traits
- After two or more years growing in the ocean, sockeye salmon travel thousands of kilometres to return to the freshwater stream where they hatched
- Males compete to fertilize eggs as they are laid
- When breeding is finished, all the adults die

Variables
1. Physiological function of Na pumps in gills (saltwater to freshwater)
2. Migration pathways of individuals
3. Behaviour of males competing for access to eggs

# Population Ecology

**Population** - A group of individuals of the same species living in the same geographic area at the same time

- Focus on how the number and distribution of individuals in a population change over time
- Researchers use mathematical models to predict the future of salmon population
- These populations have declined due to the over-harvesting and degradation of habitat cause by pollution and dam construction

Variables
1. Number of salmon spawning in streams each year
2. Number of eggs produced by females
3. Geographic range of salmon catches or sightings


# Community Ecology

**Community** - All the population of different species that interact with each other in a certain area

- Natures interaction between species and the consequences of those interactions
- Research might concentrate on predation, parasitism, and competition, or explore how communities respond to fires, flood, and other disturbances
- In saltwater, salmon eat smaller fish, and are eaten by orcas, sea lions, humans, and other mammals
- In freshwater, salmon are subject to parasitism, disease, and disturbances (change is food supply and quality of streams)

Variables
1. Prey species in gut contents of salmon
2. Density of gill parasites in salmon in different streams
3. Fish biodiversity in different stream communities



# Ecosystem Ecology

**Ecosystem** - All the organisms that live in a geographic area, together with the nonliving (abiotic) components that affect or exchange materials with the organisms; a community and its physical environment


- Ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal, population, and community ecology


**Abiotic** - Not alive
- Air, water, and non-living parts of soil

- Biologists study how nutrients and energy move among organisms and through the surrounding atmosphere and soil or water
- Salmon link marine and freshwater ecosystems
- They harvest nutrients in the ocean, and migrate, die, and decompose, in streams and stream-side forests
- Salmon transport chemical energy and nutrients from one habitat to another

Variables
- Decomposition rate of salmon in different streams
- Levels of soil nitrogen in forests with and without salmons streams
- Rate of sedimentation of streams in deforested watersheds

# Global Ecology

**Biosphere** - The thin zone surrounding Earth where all life exists; the sum of all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems

- The biosphere extends ~5 km bellow the land, and 10 km in the deepest trenches of the sea, to over 10 km into the atmosphere
- This only represents 0.005% of Earth's diameter

Variables
1. Frequency of floods and droughts in global salmon habitats
2. Northward shift of salmon due to climate change

- The biosphere is practically a closed system, the actions of the people in one part of the world may alter distant ecosystems


Salmon Migration in a Warming World
- Every year salmon migrate up British Columbia's Fraser River and leave in their natal streams
- Salmon stop feeding in fresh water, only relying on resources stored during the sea
- There was considerable variation in the percentage of maximum aerobic scope available at different temperature
- Physiological adaptation to the demands of migration varies among sockeye salmon stocks
- Different stocks will have different abilities to cope with temperatures increases due to climate change

# Conservation Biology Applies All Levels of Ecological Study


**Conservation biology** - The effort to study, preserve, and restore genetic diversity, species diversity, and diversity of ecosystem function in populations, communities, and ecosystems

- Conservation biologists prescribe remedies for threatened environments to preserve biodiversity, clean air, pure water, and productive soils

Two-Eyed Seeing: Indigenous and Scientific Knowledge in Ecology
- The Two-Eyed Seeing is a guiding principle for collaboration between Indigenous peoples and government scientists

3 Examples

1. Three major dams built upstream from the delta have altered water flow, affecting fish and wildlife

- Indigenous knowledge based on interviews with First Nations Elders, fishers, hunters, and trappers
- Archival records of government policies
- Information collected from scientific instrumentation and fish-landing data


# ==49.2 - What Determines the Distribution and Abundance of Organisms?==

---
- The range of conditions that a species can tolerate and the range of resources it can use if referred to in ecology as its ecological niche
- A niche is a product of many abiotic and biotic factors

![[Pasted image 20250409111412.png|500]]

# Present Abiotic Factors

**Fitness trade-offs** - In evolutionary biology, an inescapable compromise between two traits that cannot be optimized simultaneously

- Organisms tend to be adapted to a limited set of abiotic conditions
	- Temperature
	- Moisture
	- Water depth
	- Flow of water

Acai palm conditions
- Cannot tolerate freezing temperatures
- Can tolerate heat as long as they are not dry
- Require wet soils that are occasionally flooded
- Cannot tolerate salt water

- Temperature has a major impact on physiology
- Enzymes are particularly sensitive to temperature and tend to function optimally in a narrow temperature range
- Temperature can ultimately control growth and reproduction of organisms
- Water availability can also affect life
- ~75% of the volume of a typical cell is water, which serves as a solvent, a source of physical support, and a temperature buffer

![[Pasted image 20250409111846.png|500]]

- The resulting model is a set of curves that represent the temperature niche (thermal niche) for each species
- Coconut palm and acai palm are both tropical species preferring high average temperatures
- Acai has a narrower temperature niches
- Niche models are a useful tool for quantifying and simplifying complex ecological relationships
	- Explore theoretical principles
	- Make predications
	- Visualize data
	- Include one or many variable
- x-axis: Environmental variables
- y-axis: Number or frequency of individuals in the species
- Curve shows the range of the condition tolerated and the relative abundance of individuals at each part of the range


# Present Biotic Factors

**Biotic** - Living, or produced by a living organism

**Dispersal** - The movement of individuals from their place of origin (birth, hatching) to a new location


- When toucans consume acai they fly and poop seeds
- These seeds have a higher rate of germination after passing through the bird's gut than they do if the fruit falls directly to the ground
- Palms and toucans have coevolved in a mutualistic relationship, influencing the survival and geographic distribution of the order
- Some species of fungus can parasitize palms, stealing their nutrients and lowering their fitness


# Past Abiotic Factors

- According to the theory of plate tectonics, the landforms and oceans that appear static not have been in constant flux for the entire history of life
- Mountains rise and fall and whole continents crash together and break a part due to continental drift
- Alfred Russel Wallace was the first to recognize the the connection between historic geographic changes and the present distribution of organisms
- Wallace founded the study of biogeography

**Biogeography** - The study of how species and populations are distributed geographically

- Did palms occur on the ancient continent of Pangaea?
- Are there palms in western Africa that are closely related to the palms in eastern South America?
- Did the formation of the Isthmus of Panama enable palms to disperse north or south?
- When the Andes Mountains arose, did the rivers fragment the palm populations, leading to speciation


# Past Biotic Factors

- Evolution of plants from water onto land about 475 mya
- Recent extinction of species that were once part of tropical forest communities
- Modern humans began dispersing around the globe from Africa about 80 000 ya
	- Land-use changes, such as clearing forests and damming streams
	- Hunting, fishing, and other forms of harvesting
	- Dispersing organisms to new locations

**Exotic species** - A nonnative species that is introduced into a new area. Exotic species often are competitors, pathogens, or predators, of native species

**Invasive species** - An exotic (nonnative) species that, upon introduction to a new area, spreads rapidly and competes successfully with native species

- Invasive grasses can prevent regrowth of native palms
- European green crab that threatens shellfish on the Atlantic coast
- Eurasian purple loosestrife that is displacing native plants from wetlands
- European garlic mustard that is invading hardwood forests in eastern Canada
- Zebra mussels from Russia that threaten native bivalves in the Great Lakes


# Looking to the Future
- How will the current rapid rate of climate change affect the geographic distribution of acai palms
- Acai berries have become economically important in Brazil
- The suitable area for the growth of acai palms increases slightly, contracting in some areas and expanding in others, but factors not included in the model may reduce the range of palms

3 Messages
1) Start with the basics, then add more complexity
2) Ecology is interdisciplinary
3) Humans degrade ecological systems yet depend on ecological systems


# ==49.3 - Climate Patterns==

---

**Weather** - The short-term atmospheric conditions of temperature, moisture, sunlight, and wind at a specific place and time

**Climate** - The prevailing, long-term weather conditions in a particular region


# Why Are the Tropics Warm and the Poles Cold?

- Over the course of a year, regions at or near the equator receive much more sunlight per unit area, than regions that are closer to the poles
- At the equator, the Sun is often directly overhead at midday
- Sunlight strikes the surface at or close to an angle of 90 degrees
- Earth receives a maximum amount of solar radiation per unit area
- Sun strikes the surface at lower and lower angles moving towards the poles, therefore less energy is received per unit area

![[Pasted image 20250409144546.png|400]]

- The pattern of decreasing average temperature with increasing latitude is a result of Earth's spherical shape


# Why Are the Tropics Wet?

- Areas along the equator receive the most moisture
- Locations about 30 latitude north and south of the equator are among the driest on the planet
- A major cycle in global air circulation, called Hadley cell, is responsible for making the Amazon River basin wet and the Sahara dry

**Hadley cell** - An atmospheric cycle of large-scale air movement in which warm equatorial air rises, moves north or south, and then descends at approximately 30 N or 30 S latitude

- Air that is heated by the sun at the equator expands, lowering its pressure and causing it to rise
- Warm water molecules tend to stay in vapour form instead of condensing into droplets
- As air rises above the equator, it cools; its ability to hold water declines, producing rain
- The cooler air above Earth's surface is pushes poleward
- When the air mass has cooled, its density increases and begins to sink
- As air sinks, it absorbs more and more solar radiation reflected from Earth's surface and warms, gaining water-holding capacity
- Air approaching the Earth "hold on" to its water, and little rain occurs where it returns to the surface

![[Pasted image 20250409145156.png|500]]

- High levels of precipitation occur along the equator and a band of desserts occurs in the vicinity of 30 latitude N and S
- The result is 6 major cells of moving air encircling the globe
- Air within each cell does not move in a straight north-south or south-north direction
- The spinning of the Earth on its axis causes a Coriolis Effect

**Coriolis effect** - The tendency for moving air or water to be deflected from a straight path, swerving in a clockwise pattern in the Northern Hemisphere and in a counterclockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere. Caused by the spinning of the Earth on its axis


# What Causes Seasonality in Weather?

- Seasons are defined as regular, annual fluctuations in temperatures, precipitation, or both
- Earth's distance from the Sun changes very little
- Seasonality occurs because Earth is tilted on its north-to-south axis by 23.5 degrees
- Due to this incline, the orbiting Earth's Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun in June

![[Pasted image 20250409145620.png|500]]


# What Regional Effects Do Mountains and Oceans Have on Climate?

- The broad patterns of climate that are dictated by global heating patterns, air circulation cells, and seasonality are modified by regional effects
- The most important are due to the presence of mountain ranges and proximity to an ocean


Mountain Ranges Affect Regional Climate
- In northern latitudes, the prevailing winds are from the west and bring moisture-laden air from the Pacific Ocean
- As the air masses begin to rise over the mountains, the air cools and releases large volumes of water as rain
- Once cooled air has passed the crest of the mountain range, the air is dry
- Areas that receive this dry air are in a rain shadow

**Rain shadow** - The dry region on the side of a mountain range away from the prevailing wind

![[Pasted image 20250409150026.png|500]]

Oceans Affect Regional Climate
- The presence of mountain ranges tend to produce extremes in precipitation, the presence of an ocean has a moderating influence on temperature
- Water has a high specific heat

**Specific heat** - The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 c; a measure of the capacity of a substance to absorb energy

- Water can absorb a great deal of heat from the atmosphere in summer
- Ocean moderates summer temperature on nearby landmasses
- Ocean releases heat in the winter
- Island and costal areas have more moderate climate than inland areas
- Ocean currents can influence local climate patterns
- Ocean current flow in cycles, or gyres

**Gyres** - A large-scale ocean circulation or cycle that flows in the clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and in the counterclockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere (due to the Coriolis effect)

- Gyres result in warm water in colder latitudes and colder water in warmer latitudes

![[Pasted image 20250409150452.png|400]]

# Do Biotic Factors Affect Climate?
- The transpiration and evaporation of water from tropical forests increases cloud formation and regional rainfall
- Organisms produce and absorb greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which affect global temperature by influencing how much heat is retained in the atmosphere
- The burning of fossil fuels by humans is accelerating the release of GHG into the atmosphere, causing rapid change to global climate

# ==49.4 - Types of Terrestrial Biomes==

---

**Biomes** - A large terrestrial or aquatic region characterized by distinct abiotic characteristics and dominant types of vegetation

# What Are the Major Natural Terrestrial Biomes?

- Ecologists and geographers have collaborated to map the global distribution of naturally occurring terrestrial biomes
- Different ecosystems may belong to the same biome
	- Sonoran Desert in North America
	- Sahara in Africa
	- Both part of the same biome (subtropical desert)

![[Pasted image 20250409150911.png]]

7 Major Biomes:
1) Artic tundra
2) Boreal forest
3) Temperature coniferous forest
4) Temperature forest
5) Temperature grassland
6) Desert and dry shrubland
7) Tropical wet forest

- Each terrestrial biome is associated with a distinct set of abiotic conditions determines by climate
	- Temperature
	- Moisture
	- Sunlight
	- Wind

- Of the 4 interdependent components of climate, variation in temperature and moisture are the most important in determining plant distribution and abundance
- The type of terrestrial biome that developed is governed by
	- Average annual temperature and precipitation
	- Annual variation in temperature and precipitation


**Net primary productivity (NPP)** - In an ecosystem, the total amount of biomass generated by the fixation of carbon through photosynthesis per year minus the amount oxidized during cellular respiration


**Biomass** - The total mass of all organisms in a given population or geographical area; usually expressed as total dry weight

- Carbon compounds that are oxidized during cellular respiration release energy to organisms and carbon to the atmosphere, to they are not available for the production of biomass
- NPP represents the organic matter that is available as food for other organisms
- NPP is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass

**Aboveground biomass** - The total mass of living plants in an area, excluding roots

- Photosynthesis, plant growth, and NPP are maximized on land when sunlight is available, temperatures are warm, and conditions are wet
- Photosynthesis cannot occur in low sunlight, low temperatures, or under drought stress

![[Pasted image 20250409151732.png]]

# Human Land Use Is Displacing Natural Biomes

- Increase in human population is driving land-use change and other impacts so significant that researchers have called for a new epoch of history - the Anthropocene
	- More than 75% of Earth's ice-free land shows evidence of direct alteration by humans
		- Farming
		- Logging
		- Urban development
	- The remaining regions, or wildlands, account for 11% of terrestrial new primary productivity
- The patchwork of fragments of natural biomes, and anthromes has inspired a branch of study called landscape ecology, which measures the structure of these patchwork landscapes and their ecological processes, such a the flow of nutrients through watersheds

**Landscape ecology** - A field of ecological study that measures the structure and ecological function of landscapes that are a patchwork of fragments of natural ecosystems mixed with human-impacted areas such as roads, farms, and towns

![[Pasted image 20250409152809.png|400]]

# How Is Global Climate Change Affecting Terrestrial Biomes?

How Do Scientists Study the Effects of Climate Change on Biomes?
- 4 kinds of strategies
	- Simulation studies
	- Observational studies
	- Historical studies
	- Experiments
- Arctic regions are projected to experience dramatic changes in temperature and precipitation, many of these experiments have been conducted in the tundra biome


Climate Change Is Causing Terrestrial Biomes to Shift
- Characteristics of the vegetation inside randomly dispersed chambers are recorded annually
- The same studies are made on plots that lack chambers
- The average annual temperature inside the chamber increases by 1-3 degrees
	- Overall, species diversity decreases
	- Compared with control plots, grasses and shrubs increase inside the chambers, and mosses and lichens decrease
- The experimental results predict that the Arctic tundra environments are giving way to boreal forest, which is a shift in biome

Tipping Points Cause Abrupt Changes in Biomes
- There is growing evident that small perturbations in climate in some areas will cause abrupt changes to biomes
- Scientists predict that decreased rainfall over the Amazon will cause a rapid transition from forest to grassland due to the positive feedback loops in the system
- Decreased forest cover will decrease the rate of rain-cloud formation, which will further decrease rainfall
- This will increase fires, and decrease forest cover


Climate Variability Is Increasing within Biomes
- Increases in average global temperature are increasing variability in temperature and precipitation
- Climate are becoming more extreme
- Cold snaps in Texas have increased the frequency of cold-tolerant lizards


# ==49.5 - Types of Aquatic Biomes==

---
- About 70% of Earth's surface is covered in water
- Salmon migrate between a freshwater aquatic biome and a marine aquatic biome
- The major abiotic factor that distinguish streams and lakes from oceans include salinity, water depth, water, flow, and nutrient availability


# Salinity

**Salinity** - The proportion of solutes dissolved in water in natural environments, often designated in grams of solute per kilogram of water (cited as parts per thousand)

- The water in clouds is nearly pure, but as rainwater percolates through soils and flows across rocks, it picks up solutes
- Fresh water has low solute concentrations
- As fresh water steadily flows into the oceans, it continually adds solutes
- As water evaporates from the oceans, it leaves the solutes causing high concentrations of solutes in seawater
- The salinity of fresh water varies from ~0.06-0.3 parts/thousand
- Ocean is constant at 35 parts/thousand
- Solutes with a positive change
	- Sodium
	- Potassium
	- Magnesium
	- Calcium
- Combine with a negative charge
	- Chlorine
	- Bromine
	- Fluorine
- To form salts
- Calcium carbonate has a low solubility in water, so it precipitates as limestone at the bottom of the ocean
- Sodium chloride has high solubility in water that is makes up about 86% of sea salt
- Since salinity dramatically affects osmosis and water balance in organisms, species have physiological adaptations that allow them to cope with a specific range in salinity
- 97.5% of Earth's water is salt water in the ocean
- Most of the remaining 2.5% of fresh water is in ice caps and glacier


# Water Depth and Sunlight Availability

- Water absorbs and scatters light, so the amount and types of wavelengths available to organisms change as water depth increases
- Light availability has a major effect on productivity
- At the water surface, all wavelengths of light are equally available
- Ocean water absorbs light in the red region, resulting in a blue hue of underwater scenes
- Key photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll have high absorption peaks for red wavelengths
- The productivity of photosynthetic organisms are constrained underwater since red wavelengths are unavailable

![[Pasted image 20250409172537.png|400]]

- The quantity of light available to organisms also diminished rapidly with increasing depth
- In pure seawater, the total amount of light available at a depth of 10 m is less than 40%
- Virtually no light reaches depths greater than 200m

![[Pasted image 20250409172659.png|500]]

6 Common Zones in the Ocean:
1) Intertidal zone
2) Neritic zone
3) Oceanic zone
4) Benthic zone
5) Photic zone
6) Aphotic zone

**Intertidal zone** - The region between the low-tide and high-tide marks on a seashore

**Neritic zone** - shallow marine waters beyond the intertidal one, extending down to about 200 metres, where the continental shelf ends

**Continental shelf** - The portion of a geologic plate that extends under seawater from a continent

**Oceanic zone** - The deeper waters of the open ocean beyond the continental shelf

**Benthic zone** - The area along the bottom of an aquatic environment

**Photic zone** - In an aquatic habitat, water that is shallow enough to receive some sunlight (whether or not it enough to support photosynthesis)

**Aphotic zone** - Deep water receiving no sunlight


- In the tropics, shallow portions of the neritic zone host the most productive environments
	- Coral reefs


**Coral reefs** - A large assemblage of colonial marine corals that usually serves as shallow-water, sunlit habitat for many other species as well

- The autotrophs in coral-reef ecosystem include not only algae that live on the reef but also mutualistic protists called dinoflagellates that live within corals
	- These cause coral pigments
- Primary productivity and biodiversity are extremely high in these areas

5 Common Zones in Lakes:
1) Littoral zone
2) Limnetic zone

**Littoral zone** - Shallow water near shore that receives enough sunlight to support photosynthesis and is shallow enough for plants to take root; often flowering plants are present

**Limnetic zone** - Open water that receives enough sunlight to support photosynthesis but is too deep for plants to take root

- Drifting organisms called plankton are abundant in photic zone, comprising photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria as well as the small crustaceans, fish, and other animals that eat them
- Detritus are abundant in the benthic zone and eaten by invertebrates and fish

**Plankton** - Drifting small or microscopic organisms that serve as a food source in aquatic environment (includes animals, plants, protists, archaea, and bacteria)

**Detritus** - A layer of dead organic matter that accumulates at ground level or on seafloor and lake bottoms

- The turbidity determines light penetration, and is caused by erosion, or human activities such as runoff and algae bloom

**Turbidity** - Cloudiness of water caused by sediments and/or microscopic organisms

# Water Flow
- Water flow enhances the availability of oxygen, light, and nutrients
- Fast-moving water near the source of streams tends to be high in O2, clear, and low in nutrients
- Slower-flowing water downstream tends to be lower in O2, more turbid, and more nutrient rich
- Water can sweep away organisms
- Biomechanics studies the mechanical implications of water flow to the physiology, evolution, and ecology of aquatic organisms


# Nutrient Availability
- Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are in short supply
- Scarcity of nutrients limit growth rates in the photosynthetic organisms that provide food for other species
- The benthic organisms in the aphotic zone survive by consuming detritus that sinks from the photic zone

3 Types of Water Flow
1) Coastal runoff
2) Ocean upwelling
3) Lake turnover


Coastal Runoff
- Nutrients tend to be plentiful in the shallow estuaries where freshwater creeks and rivers meet the sea
- Nutrients and sunlight are plentiful, resulting in estuaries being the most productive environments on Earth

**Estuaries** - An aquatic biome formed where streams and ocean meet, such that freshwater and salt water mix; highly productive because of abundant light and nutrients

Ocean Upwelling
- Nutrients are brought up by currents that cause upwelling
- Winds blows water north causing the current to be moved offshore and replaced by water moving up from the ocean bottom
- Due to periodic lulls in the trade winds, called El Nino events, warm water stays near the shore and upwelling stalls, devastating the fishery

![[Pasted image 20250409174752.png|400]]

Lake Turnover
- The great majority of natural bodies of fresh water are found in high latitude areas that were scoured by glaciers
- In temperate regions, these bodies of water undergo spring and fall turnovers

**Turnovers** - In lake ecology, the complete mixing of upper and lower layers of water of different temperatures; occurs each spring and fall in temperature-zone lakes

![[Pasted image 20250409174920.png|600]]

- In winter ice is oxygen rich because it is exposed to the atmosphere
- A gradient in temperature called the thermocline ("heat slope")/thermal stratification forms

**Thermocline** - A steep gradient (cline) in environmental temperature, such as occurs in a thermally stratified lake or ocean

- In spring the temperature rises until it reaches 4 degrees
- The surface water is heaver and falls
- During this spring turnover, the bottom of the lake carries sediments and nutrients to the surface
- This flush of nutrients causes a rapid increase in the growth of photosynthetic algae and bacteria (spring bloom)
- In fall turnover oxygen rich water is brought to the bottom

![[Pasted image 20250409175337.png|600]]


# How Are Aquatic Biomes Affected by Humans?
- Human affect on aquatic biomes
	- Eliminate aquatic biomes by filing or draining wetlands, damming streams, and removing water from ponds and rivers for agricultural irrigation
	- Create new aquatic anthromes such as municipal reservoirs, decorative or recreational ponds and lakes, stormwater drainage systems, and agricultural ditches
	- Disrupt aquatic communities
	- Dispose of debris
	- Global climate change influences aquatic ecosystem

**Eutrophication** - a process where water bodies, become overly enriched with nutrients from nitrogen and phosphorus
