**Conservation biology** - The effort to study, preserve, and restore genetic diversity, species diversity of ecosystem function in populations, communities, and ecosystems

# ==54.1 - What Is Biodiversity?==

---

**Biodiversity** - The diversity of life considered at three levels: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity



# Biodiversity Can Be Measured and Analyzed at Several Levels





*Genetic Diversity*

**Genetic diversity** - The diversity of alleles or genes in a population, species, or group of species


*Species Diversity*

**Species richness** - The number of species present in a given ecological community

**Species diversity** - The variety and relative abundance of the species present in a given ecological community

**DNA barcoding** - The use of well-characterized gene sequences to identify species


*Ecosystem Diversity*

**Ecosystem diversity** - The variety of biotic components in a region along with abiotic components, such as soil, water, and nutrients

**Ecosystem function** - The sum of biological and chemical process that are characteristic of a given ecosystem, such as primary production, nitrogen cycling, and carbon storage




*Change through Time*

# How Many Species Are Living Today?

*Taxon-Specific Surveys*

*All-Taxa Surveys*

# Where Is Biodiversity Highest?

*Mapping Species Richness*

*Mapping Endemism, Phylogenetic Diversity, and Functional Diversity*

**Endemic species** - A species that lives in one geographic area and nowhere else

**Biodiversity hotspot** - A region that is extraordinarily rich in species


*Mapping Biodiversity Hotspots*

# ==54.2 - Threats to Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function

---

**Endangered species** - A species whose numbers have decreased so much that it in danger of extinction throughout all or part of its range


# Multiple Interacting Threats

*Habitat Destructions*

**Habitat destruction** -  Human-caused destruction of a natural habitat, replace by an urban, suburban, or agricultural landscape


*Habitat Degradation*

**Habitat degradation** - The human-caused reduction of the quality of a habitat

**Habitat fragmentation** - The breakup of a large region of a habitat into many smaller regions, separated from others by a different type of habitat




*Overexploitation*

**Overexploitation** - Unsustainable removal of wildlife form the natural environment for use by humans


*Invasive Species and Disease*

**Exotic species** - A nonnative species that is introduced into a new area
- Exotic species often are competitors, pathogens, or predators of native species

**Invasive species** - An exotic species that, upon introduction to a new area, spreads rapidly and compete successfully with native species


*Pollution*

*Climate Change*

# How Will These Threats Affect Future Extinction Rates?

*Estimating the Probability Will do Extinct*

*Estimating the Effect of Habitat Area on Species Richness*

**Species-area relationships** - The mathematical relationship between the area of a certain habitat and the number of species that is can support




*Estimating the Effect of Climate Change on Species Distributions*

*Take-Home Messages Making Biodiversity Predictions*


# ==54.3 - Why Are Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function Important?==

# Biological Benefits of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function

*Biodiversity Increases Productivity*

*Does Biodiversity Lead to Stability?*

**Resistance** - A measure of the extend to which a community remains unchanged in the face of a disturbance

**Resilience** - A measure of how quickly a community recovers following a disturbance

**Natural experiment** - A situation in which a natural change in conditions enables comparisons of groups, rather than a manipulation of conditions by researchers


# Ecosystem Services: Economic and Social Benefits of Biodiversity and Ecosystems

**Ecosystem services** - All of the benefits that humans derive, directly or indirectly, from ecosystem function


*Provisioning Services*

**Bioprospecting** - The effort to find commercially useful compounds by studying organisms, especially species that are poorly studies to date


*Regulating Services*

*Cultural Services*

*Supporting Services*

# An Ethical Dimension



# ==54.4 - Preserving Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function==

# Addressing the Ultimate Causes of Loss

# Conservation Strategies to Preserve Genetic Diversity, Species, and Ecosystem Function

*Education Campaigns*

*Seed Banks*

**Seed banks -** A repository where seeds, representing many different variety of domestic crops or other species, are preserved


*Management Plans for Invasive Species*

*Management Plans for Threatened Species*

*Ex Situ Conservation and Reintroduction of Animals*

**Ex situ conservation** - Preserving species outside of natural areas (ex. in zoos, aquaria, or botanical gardens)


*Wildlife Corridors*

**Wildlife corridors** - Strips of wildlife habitat connecting populations that otherwise would be isolated by human-made development

*Designating Effective Protected Areas*

*Ecosystem Restoration*

*Quantifying Ecosystem Services*

**Ecotourism** - Tourism that is based on observing wildlife or experiencing other aspects of natural areas
