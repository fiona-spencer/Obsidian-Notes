**Behaviour** - Any action by an organism, or response to a stimulus

**Behavioural ecology** - A discipline that focuses on behavioural adaptation that have evolve in response to ecological selection pressures subset of organismal ecology, which also includes morphological and physiological adaptations


# ==50.1 - An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology==

---
- Behavioural ecology focuses at the level of the organism, and integrates levels from molecules up to the ecosystem
- 2 Fundamental Test Hypotheses
	- Proximate
	- Ultimate


# Proximate and Ultimate Causation

Biological Causation:
1. Proximate (mechanistic)
2. Ultimate (evolutionary)

**Proximate** - In biology, the immediate, mechanistic cause of a phenomenon, as opposed to why it evolved
- Genetic, neurological, hormonal, and skeletal-muscular mechanisms

**Ultimate** - In biology, the reason that a trait or phenomenon is thought to have evolved; the adaptive advantage of that trait

Do Male Redback Spiders Benefit from Being Eaten by Their Mates?
- Male midges, male scorpions, and most male praying mantises may be devoured by their mates during or after copulation
- The male redback spider actively solicits his own consumption, and females never eat males that do not somersault into their jaws
- Before a male mates, he develops an abdominal constriction that protects his heart and other vital organs
- Research suggests that the male's self-sacrifice is an adaptive behaviour that increases his reproductive success
- Only ~20% of males succeed in reaching the web of a redback female
- A female redback spider mates for a longer period of time if she is eating her mate


Proximate Causes: How Does Consolation Behaviour Occur?
- When someone is in distress, neutrons in the brain process this sensory information and cause some interesting changes
- The brain first signals the adrenal gland (above kidneys) to produce more cortisol, causing a empathy response
- Neural signals in the posterior pituitary in the brain signal oxytocin, which activates the anterior cingulate cortex, which stimulates a caregiving response
- The neuronal and physiological responses are reduced if the person is a stranger
- Proximate causation
	- To remove or supply a hypothesized molecular or cellular mechanism then see if the behaviour occurs in response

Ultimate Causes: Why Does Consolation Behaviour Occur?
- Traits that strengthen social bonds are favoured by natural selection

# Types of Behaviour: An Overview
- Behaviours differ in the extent to which they are learned and their flexibility

![[Pasted image 20250409190323.png|500]]


Some Behaviours Are More Learned and Flexible

**Innate behaviour** - Behaviour that is inherited genetically, does not have to be learned, and it typical of species

**Fixed action patterns** - Highly stereotyped behaviour pattern that occurs in a certain invariant way in a certain species
- A form of innate behaviour
- Yawn and sneeze

- Innate behaviours tend to be inflexible and so not align well to real world environmental changes
- Inflexible, innate actions that were tested
	- Goose chicks imprint on their mother

Some Behaviours Are More Learned and Flexible

**Learning** - An enduring change in an individual's behaviour that results from a specific experience

- Unlike innate behaviours, learned behaviours can spread through populations
- In control colonies that contained the reward apparatus but no trained bees, none of the bees learned how to retrieve the reward

![[Pasted image 20250409190850.png|500]]

- Learning is an adaptive behaviour strategy in changing or unpredictable environments
- The capacity to learn has a genetic basis and varies among individuals and species
- Individuals and species whose behaviours have higher flexibility are predicted to be more likely to survive rapid changes in temperatures, precipitation, and shifting interaction with other species

# Choices Involve Trade-Offs

**Fitness trade-offs** - In evolutionary biology, an inescapable compromise between two traits that cannot be optimized simultaneously

- It is impossible for an animal to simultaneously maximize the energy invested in finding food and the energy invested in finding mates

**Cost-benefit analysis** - Decisions or analyses that weigh the fitness costs and benefits of a particular action


2 Important Concepts
1. Choices are not usually conscious
2. The behaviour of individuals varies within populations



# ==50.2 - Choosing What, How, and When to Eat==

---

- When animals seek food, they are foraging

**Foraging** - searching for food

- Why individuals eat the way they do
	- Research on genetic variation in foraging behaviour
	- The concept of optimal foraging


# Proximate Causes: Foraging Alleles in _Drosophila melanogaster_
- Rover alleles in larvae is dominant over the sitter alleles, the that the protein product for the _for_ gene in involved in a signal transduction cascade in the nervous system
	- Involved in the response to cell-cell signals in neurons
- Adults files express the same foraging alleles as larval files
- Genes that are homologous to _for_ have now been found in honeybees and the roundworms

# Ultimate Causes: Optimal Foraging
- Rover allele in fruit fly larvae is favoured when populations density is high and food is in short supply
- Sitter allele reaches high frequency in low-density populations, where food is abundant
- These results link a proximate mechanisms with an ultimate outcome
- The presence of certain alleles is responsible for a difference in fitness in specific types of habitats
- In _Drosophila_, foraging is a relatively inflexible and innate behaviour
- The variability of food supplies maintains alleles in the populations


Introduction to Optimal Foraging

**Optimal foraging** - The concept that animals forage in a way that maximizes the amount of usable energy they take in, given the costs of finding and ingesting their food and the risk of being eaten while they're at it

$Fitness ∝ FeedingEfficiency ∝\frac{Benefits}{Costs}$

- When animals forage optimally that are expected to be favoured by natural selection
- Organisms within populations are never "perfect" due do fitness tradeoffs, genetic and historical constraints, and constantly changing environments
	- Antarctic fur seals optimize their foraging by adjusting the duration and location of each dive depending on the depth and density of patches of food
	- Bumblebees optimize their flight paths among flowers to minimize the overall distance travelled while foraging

A Test of Optimal Foraging in Cuttlefish
- Cephalopods have the most complex brains of all invertebrates and complex cognitive behaviours to match
- Cuttlefish can "count" and typically select optimal choices when hunting for prey

Observations
- Cuttlefish can "count" and chose the number of their prey
- Cuttlefish chose the size of their prey
- Cuttlefish chose the quality of their prey

- the cuttlefish showed that they weigh the number, size, and quality of two meal options at the same time
- On average, cuttlefish chose the meals that offered them the highest net benefit, the highest quantity of quality food
- Statistical test comparing meal choices consistently produce P < 0.01, indicating that the difference were statistically significant
- Hungry cuttlefish are more willing to risk capturing larger shrimp then satiated cuttlefish, suggesting that they weigh the cost of capture in their meal choices as well as the benefits


Introduction to Evolutionary Game Theory

**Evolutionary game theory** - A mathematical modelling approach to predicting the outcome of natural selection on behaviours when multiple "players" are interacting

- The core idea of game theory is that the behavioural strategy of one player depends on how it perceives the behavioural strategy of others








# ==50.3 - Choosing a Mate==

---
- Patterns, called mating systems
	- Monogamy
	- Polygamy
	- Promiscuity

**Monogamy** - A type of mating system where one male mates with one female per breeding season, forming a pair bond

**Promiscuity** - A type of mating system where both males and females mate with multiple partners during a breeding season

**Polygamy** - A type of mating system where one male mates with two or more females or one female mates with more than one male during a breeding season

![[Pasted image 20250410114005.png|500]]

- 3 important insights about mating systems
	- Mating systems vary a lot among species, and even among individuals
	- Mating systems are not always as they appear
	- Mating behaviours can serve functions other than producing offspring


# Proximate Causes: How Is Sexual Activity Initiated in _Anolis_ Lizards?

- Mate choice typically involved a _chooser_ and a _counter_ and some kind of signal, an information-containing behaviour or characteristic
- The "choice" in a mate is rarely conscious; rather it is a complex neural, hormonal, and motor response to sensory inputs


**Signal** - In behavioural ecology, any information-containing behaviour or characteristic that has been shaped by natural selection

**Territory** - An area that is actively defended by an animal and that provides exclusive or semi-exclusive use of its resources by the owner

- Lizards are socially polygynous, where each male defends a feeding area sufficient to support 2 to 6 females
- Males signal sexual readiness to females by extending a brightly coloured patch of skin called a dewlap and bobbing up and down
- Sexual behaviour is seasonal, from April to August, as indicated by the size of sexual organs in males and females relative to overall body size

![[Pasted image 20250410114646.png|400]]

- The proximate cause to sexual behaviours is sex hormones, testosterone in males and estradiol in females
- Testosterone is produced in the testes of males, and estradiol in the ovaries of females
- Testosterone injections induce courtship activity in castrated males with not prior courtship activity
- Estradiol injections induce sexual activity in females whose ovaries have been removed
- Females that were exposed to springlike condition began producing eggs, females in the field that were not exposed to springlike conditions did not
- Females that were exposed to breeding males began producing eggs much earlier than did females that were alone, with other females, or with castrated males
- Females that were exposed to breeding males whose dewlaps has been surgically removed were slow to produce eggs, as slow as females groups with castrated males
- Two types of signals are necessary to produce the hormonal changes that leag to sexual behaviour in _Anolis_ lizards
- Females must be exposed to springlike conditions and to breeding males with dewlaps

# Ultimate Causes: Sexual Selection

**Sexual selection** - A type of natural selection that favours individuals with traits that increase their ability to obtain mate or choose good mates

**Intersexual selection** - A type of sexual selection in which an individual of one sex chooses a particular individual of the other sex of mating

**Intrasexual selection** - A type of sexual selection in which two individuals of the same sex compete with one another for mates

- Red deer males that win physical battles with other males tend to have higher mating success, as do pharaoh cuttlefish that successfully intimidate other males using threatening displays

- Both dewlap extensions and push-ups are signals what woo females, supporting intersexual selection
- Push-ups are also used as territorial displays in the presence in males, which is shown as intrasexual selection

![[Pasted image 20250410115916.png|500]]

- Many females are also mating with males from other territories (promiscuous)
- This behaviour increases the fitness of females by increasing the genetic diversity of their offspring


# ==50.4 - Choosing Where to Go==

---

**Migration** - In ecology, a seasonal long-distance movement of large number of organisms from one geographic location or habitat to another. In population genetics, movement of individuals from one population to another

- At the proximate level, how do animals know where to go between on seasonal "home" and another?
- At the ultimate level, what are the fitness benefits of living in different places in different seasons that could outweigh the cost of long-distance migrations?

# Proximate Causes: How Do Animals Navigate?

3 Categories of Navigation
1. Piloting
	1. Use of familiar landmarks
2. Compass oientation
	1. Movement that is oriented in a specific direction
3. True navigation
	1. Ability to locate a specific place on Earth's surface

**Piloting** - A type of navigation in which animals use familiar landmarks to find their way

**Compass orientation** - A type of navigation in which movement occurs in a specific direction

**True navigation** - The type of navigation by which an animal can reach a specific point on Earth's surface


Piloting
- Offspring of migratory birds and mammals navigate using piloting
- They learn the route when following their parents one or more time, and later are able to pilot the route on their own

Compass Orientation
- Most research on compass orientation has been done on migratory birds, such as robins, fish such as salmon, and insects such as butterflies
- Animals use the Sun, starts, and Earth's magnetic field to determine where north is

**Circadian clock** - An internal mechanism found in most organisms that regulates many processes in a roughly 24-hour cycle

- Animals can detect magnetism by their visual system, through a chemical reaction that involved electron transfer among molecules
- Individuals have small particles of magnetic iron, called magnetite, in their bodies
- Changes in positions of magnetic particles can be detected to provide reliable information for compass orientation

True Navigation (Map Orientation)
- Sea turtles have the ability to travel around vast areas of the ocean and then return to a specific coastal nesting or feeding site with pinpoint accuracy
- Turtles use the magnetic field as a source of precise positional information

Neutral Maps
- Some insects and other arthropods have elaborate pathway integration abilities that enables them to monitor their speed and direction during foraging trips and return home without referring to landmarks, starts, or magnetic fields
- Mammals take this neural processing a step further by forming a neural map of the physical space they experience
- The neural navigation occurs in the entorhinal cortex
- People with Alzhimer disease lose cells in this area early in their illness, which is why they wander and get lost



# Ultimate Causes: Why Do Animals Migrate?
- Arctic terns nest during summer in tundra
	- Arctic terns feed on fish that are available in different parts of the world at different seasons
- Salmon that hatch in rivers migrate to the ocean, and eventually return to the stream
	- Salmon eggs and young are safer in freshwater habitats. Adults are able to find more food in saltwater habitats, but eventually mate and die in freshwater


# ==50.5 - Communication with Others==

---

**Communication** - In ecology, any process in which a signal from one individual modifies the behaviour of another individual

- Communication is a crucial component of animal behaviour

# Proximate Causes: How Do Honeybees Communicate?
- Honeybees are highly social animals
- Bees appear to recruit to food sources, meaning that if a new source is discovered by one or a few, many more been being showing up over time
- Food finders have some way of communicating the location
- Bees move in a "waggle-dance" pattern
	- The length of the waggle run was proportional to the distance the foragers has to fly to reach the feader
	- The direction of the waggle run correlated with the direction of the food source from the hive
	- The direction of the food source was communicated as relative to the current position of the sun

![[Pasted image 20250410121832.png|300]]

![[Pasted image 20250410121848.png|500]]

- Further work has confirmed that the dance language of bees includes several modes of communication
	- Tactile information in the movements themselves
	- Sounds made during the dance
	- Scents that indicate the nature of the food source


# Ultimate Causes: Why Do Honeybees Communicate the Way They Do?
- The frequency of bee colonies is increases with more communication and food finding
- Bees, ants, and termites that live in dark nests rely on olfactory and tactile communication
- Bats, wolves, and other animals that are active at night communicate via sound or scent
- Animals during the day rely on visual communication
- Sound travels much father than light in aquatic habitats
- Whales rely on song for long-distance communication
- Songs and calls can carry information over long distance but are short lived
- Acoustic communication attracts predators


# When Is Communication Honest or Deceitful?
- Honeybees are always honest about the location of food sources

Deceiving Individuals of Another Species
- Hognose snakes have the ability to play dead
- Male and female fireflies flash a species-specific signal to each other during courtship
- Predatory fireflies can mimic the pattern of flashes given by females to attack males of different species

Deceiving Individuals of the Same Species
- Male bluegill sunfish set up nesting territories in the shallow water along lake edges, fertilize the eggs laid in their nests, care for the developing embryos by fanning when with oxygen-rich water, and protect newly hatched offspring from large predators
- Some males cheat this system, by mimicking females
- The mimic father offspring does not care for the female, but is able to fertilize eggs
- In deceitful communication it is common to find as the number of mimics increases, the reproductive success of mimics declines

# ==50.6 - Cooperating with Others==

---

**Altruism** - Any behaviour that has a fitness cost to the individual and a fitness benefit to the recipient

- Altruism is the formal term for self-sacrificing behaviour
- In terms of ultimate causation, altruistic behaviour appears to be paradoxical


# Kin Selection
- Black-tailed prairie does perform a behaviour known as alarm calling
- When a badger, coyote, hawk, or other predator approaches, some prairie does give alarm calls to alerts other prairie does to scan for threat
- Although this increases the risk for the alarm-callers


Hamilton's Rule
- William D. Hamilton created a mathematical model to assess how an allele that contributes to altruistic behaviour could increase in frequency in a population

C = fitness cost of the altruistic act
B = fitness benefit to the recipient B
*Both C and B are measured in units of offspring produced
r = the coefficient of relatedness

**Coefficient of relatedness (r)** - A measure of how closely two individual are related. Calculated as the probability that an allele in two individuals in inherited from the same ancestor

$Br > C$

- Altruistic behaviour is most likely when 3 conditions are met
	1) The fitness benefits are high for the recipient (B)
	2) The altruist and recipient are close relative (high r)
	3) The fitness costs to the altruist are low (C)

- When Hamilton's rule holds, alleles associated with altruistic behaviour will be favoured by natural selection

Inclusive Fitness
- Individuals can pass on their alleles to the next generation not only by having their own offspring, but also by helping close relatives produce more offspring

- Direct fitness
	- Derived from an individual's own offsprint
	- Parental care
- Indirect fitness
	- Derived from helping relatives produce more offspring than they could produce on their own

- The combination of direct and indirect fitness components is called inclusive fitness
- Biologist use the term kin selection to refer to the natural selection that acts through benefits to relatives at the expense of the individual

**Kin selection** - A form of natural selection that favours traits that increase survival or reproduction of an individual's kin at the expense of the individual

Testing Hamilton's Rule
- Individuals who do not have close genetic relatives nearby will rarely give an alarm call
- This pattern has been observed in social mammals and birds


# Manipulation
- Sometimes altruistic behaviour is involuntary
- Worker bees or ants sacrifice most or all of their direct reproduction to help rear the queen's offspring, a phenomenon called eusociality

**Eusociality** - A complex social structure in which workers sacrifice most or all a of their direct reproduction to help rear the queen's offspring. Common in insects such as ants, bees, wasps, and termites

- All the females in a bee society are highly related, with a coefficient of relatedness of 0.75, higher than the 0.5 of their daughters
- This suggests that is would be more adaptive for workers to raise sisters than to raise their own offspring, supporting Hamilton's rule
- Some queens mate with diploid males, or multiple, which reduced the coefficient of relatedness of workers
- Manipulation, or "enforced altruism," makes sense at the ultimate level because efficient colonies will be favoured by natural selection, while rampant "cheating" can cause colonies to collapse


# Reciprocal Altruism
- Chimps and other primates spend considerable time grooming unrelated members of their social groups
	- Cleaning fur
	- Removing ticks
- Vampire bats that have found food are known to regurgitate blood meals to non-kin that have not been successful and are in danger of starving

**Reciprocal altruism** - Altruistic behaviour that is exchanged between a pair of individuals at different times

- Vervet monkeys, groom unrelated individuals who have helped then in the past

# Cooperation and Mutualism
- Some behaviours appear altruistic, but may be selfish because they increase, rather than decrease, the fitness of the animal exhibiting the behaviour
- African wild dogs cannot hunt large prey along, but they can succeed by hunting as a pack
- Female horses that spend more time in grooming relationships with other female horses tend to suffer less harassment from males


# Individuals Do Not Act for the Good of the Species
- Is it not possible for sacrificing alleles to evolved by natural selection

# Take-Home Messages
- Biologists can use evolutionary game theory to quantify and predict social interactions among individuals, given that the behavioural strategy of one player depends on how it perceived the behavioural strategy of others
