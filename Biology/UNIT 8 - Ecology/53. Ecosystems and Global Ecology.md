**Ecosystem** - All the organisms that live in geographic area, together with the nonliving (abiotic) components that affect or exchange materials with the organisms; a community and its physical environment

**Biosphere** - The thin zone surrounding Earth where all life exists; the sum of all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems




# ==53.1 - How Does Energy Flow through Ecosystems?==

---
**Primary producers** - Any organism that creates its own food by photosynthesis or from reduced inorganic compounds and that is a food source for other species in its ecosystem

**Gross primary productivity** - In an ecosystem, the total amount of carbon fixed by photosynthesis, including that used for cellular respiration, over a given time period

**Net primary productivity (NPP)** - In an ecosystem, the total amount of biomass generated by the fixation of carbon through photosynthesis per year minus the amount oxidized during cellular respiration

**Biomass** - The total mass of all organisms in a given population or geological area; usually expressed as total dry weight



# How Efficient Are Autotrophs at Capturing Solar Energy?





# What Happens to the Biomass of Autotrophs?

**Consumers** - Any organism that cannot synthesize reduced organic compounds form inorganic sources and that must obtain them from other organisms
- Some bacteria and archaea, and virtually all fungi and animals are heterotrophs

**Primary consumers** - An herbivore, an organism that eats plants, algae, or other primary producers

**Secondary consumers** - A carnivore, an organism that eat herbivores

**Tertiary consumers** - A carnivore, in a food chain or food web, organisms that feed on secondary consumers

**Decomposers/Detritivores** - An organism whose diet consists mainly of dead organic matter (detritus)
- Various bacteria, fungi, protists, and animals

**Detritus** - A layer of dead organic matter that accumulates at ground level or on sea floors and lake bottoms





*Trophic Structure: Food Chains and Food Webs*

**Food chain** - A relatively simple pathway of energy flow through a few species, each at different trophic level, in an ecosystem
- Might include, a primary producer, a primary consumer, a secondary consumer, and a decomposer

**Grazing food chain** - The ecological network of primary producers, herbivores, and the predators and parasites that consume them

**Decomposer food chain** - The ecological network of detritus, decomposers that eat detritus, and predators and parasites of the decomposers

**Primary decomposer** - A decomposer that consumes detritus from plants

**Food webs** - The complex network of interactions among species in an ecosystem formed by the transfer of energy and nutrients among trophic levels

**Biomagnification** - In animal tissues, an increase in the concentration of particular molecules that may occur as those molecules are passed up the food chain

# ==53.2 - How Do Nutrients Cycle through Ecosystems?==

---

**Nutrients** - Any substance that an organism requires for normal growth, maintenance, or reproduction

**Biogeochemical** - The pattern of circulation of an element or molecular among living organisms and the environment


# Nutrient Cycling within Ecosystems

**Soil organic matter** - Organic (carbon-containing) compounds found in soil

**Humus** - The decayed organic matter in soils





*What Factors Control the Rate of Nutrient Cycling?*

*Sources of Local Nutrient Export and Import*

*An Experimental Study of Nutrient Cycling*

**Watersheds**


# Global Biogeochemical Cycles




*The Global Water Cycle*

**Global water cycle** - The movement of water among terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems, and the atmosphere

**Groundwater** - Any water below the land surface

**Aquifers** - An underground layer of porous rock, sand, or gravel that is saturated with water

**Water table** - The upper limit of the underground layer of soil that is saturated with water



*The Global Nitrogen Cycle*

**Global nitrogen cycle** - The movement of nitrogen among terrestrial ecosystems, the oceans, and the atmosphere


*The Global Carbon Cycle*


*The Global Phosphorus Cycle*

**Global phosphorus cycle**


# ==53.3 - Global Climate Change==

---
**Global warming** - A sustained increase in Earth's average surface temperature

**Global climate change** - The global sum of all the local changes in temperature and precipitation patterns that accompany global warming (or in some past events, global cooling)

**Weather** - The short-term atmospheric conditions of temperature, moisture, sunlight, and wind at a specific place and time

**Climate** - The prevailing, long-tern weather conditions in a particular region





# What Is the Cause of Global Climate Change




*The Greenhouse Effect*

**Greenhouse gas** - An atmospheric gas that absorbs and reflects infrared raditation, so that heat radiated from Earth is retained in the atmosphere instead of being lost to space
- Includes carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, and nitrous oxides

**Greenhouse effect** - Selective energy absorption by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which allows short-wavelength light energy to pass through but absorb longer wavelength infrared energy and reflects heat back to Earth
- Causes a warming effect similar to that in a greenhouse
