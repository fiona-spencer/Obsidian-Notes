**Population** - A group of individual of the same species living in the same geographic area at the same time

**Population ecology** - The study of how and why the number of individuals in a population changes over time and space

**Population thinking** - A way of thinking that emphasizes the importance of variation among individuals in a population; the opposite of typological thinking, which ignores variation or considers it unimportant

- Population ecologists often integrate multiple levels of organization, studying how the morphological, behavioural, or physiological adaptations of organisms enable then to survive and reproduce in certain climates
- Population ecology is an important link between evolution an ecology


# ==51.1 - Distribution and Abundance==

---
# Geographic Distribution

- Distribution and abundance are the fundamental concepts in ecology
- Most species identification guides show range, or geographic distribution

**Range** - The geographic distribution of a species

2 Factors the Determine Rage:
1) Abiotic factors
	1) Temperature
	2) Rainfall
	3) Presence of geographical structures
	4) Large-scale ongoing and historical processes
2) Biotic
	1) Past and current presence of other species

**Population density** - The number of individuals of a population per unit area

- Individual organisms can be arranged in different patterns within populations at the local scale
	- Random
	- Clumped
	- Uniform

![[Pasted image 20250410132326.png|600]]

- The dispersion pattern of a population has both proximate causes, in terms of physiology and behavioural mechanisms, and ultimate causes, in terms of evolutionary adaptations
- If a species range is small, it may consist of a single population of interbreeding individuals
- If large, may consist of many populations (contiguous or isolated)

**Metapopulation** - A population made up of many small, physically isolated population connected by migrations

- Humans have caused more isolated patches, causing more species to experience metapopulation structure of population

# Sampling Methods
- Distribution maps are always a work in processes
- For sedentary or sessile organisms, such as trees, kelp, mushrooms, researchers sample habitats by counting the individual that occur along lines of know positions and length, called transects, or rectangular plots, quadrants
- Counting organisms that are mobile is more challenging
- If individuals are captured and tagged, the total population size of mobile species can be estimated by using a sampling method called mark-recapture

M = Number of marked animals
N = Total population size
m = Number of marked animals in the recapture
n = Total number of animals (marked and unmarked) in the recapture

$\frac{M}{N} = \frac{m}{n}$

Total population size => $N = \frac{Mn}{m}$


Ex. Mark-Recapture Equation

_Suppose you trap 255 stickleback fish in a lake and mark them by clipping the first spine of their dorsal fins. One month later you recapture a total of 162 individuals, 78 of them marked. Estimate the total population size._

- $N = \frac{(255)(162)}{78} = 530$

The total population is 530.

# ==51.2 - Demography and Life History==

---
- The number of individuals present in a population depends of 4 processes
	1. Birth
	2. Death
	3. Immigration
	4. Emigration


**Immigration** - The migration of individuals into a particular population from other populations

**Emigration** - The migration of individual away from one population to other populations

![[Pasted image 20250410135214.png|300]]


**Demography** - The study of factors that determine the size and structure of populations through time

- To predict the future of a population, biologists need to know the age structure, how likely individuals of different ages are to survive to the following year, how many offspring are produced by females of different ages, and how many individuals of different ages immigrate and migrate each generation

**Age structure** - The proportion of individuals in a population that are of each possible age

**Generation** - The average time between a mother's first offspring and her daughter's first offspring

- The population size should increate if the population if mostly young individuals with high reproductive rates and a short generations time
- Population sizes decreases if the population is mostly old individuals with low reproductive rates, and a long generation time

# Life Tables


**Life table** - A data set that summarizes the probability that an individual in a certain population will survive and reproduce in any given year over the course of its lifetime

- Life tables were invented almost 2000 years ago
- Ancient Romans used them to predict food needs
- For relatively short-lived species, researchers can track individuals over time
- For longer-lived species, researchers must take a "snapshot" of the age structure at a particular time

_Zootoca vivipara_: A Case Study
- If the marked individual was not recaptured in a subsequent year, they assumed that is had died
- The data shows the number of individuals that survive each year in a particular age group as well as the offspring produced
- Population growth rates depend entirely on females

![[Pasted image 20250410135909.png|500]]


Age Class and Number Alive

**Age class** - All the individuals of a specific age in a population

- The age class shows that females have a maximum life span of about 7 years
- The second column shows how many female lizards survived to reach each age class

**Cohort** - A group of individuals that are the same age and can be followed through time

Survivorship
- The third column converts the data in the second column to proportions
- Survivorship is a key components of a life table, and is defined as the proportion of offspring produced that survive, on average, to a particular age
- Survivorship from birth to age 1, was 0.424

**Survivorship curve** - A graph depicting the percentage of a population that survives to different ages

- Biologists plot a graph with the logarithm of the number of survivors on the y-axis and age on the x-axis
- If survivorship is constant over time, the slope of the line on the semi-logarithmic plot will be constant and the line will be straight
- If the survivorship changes with age, the line will be curved

3 Types of Survivorship Curves
1. Type I
	1. Humans and large mammals
	2. Survivorship is high, until old age
2. Type II
	1. Individuals have the same probability of dying each year
	2. Blackbirds and other songbirds
3. Type III
	1. Insects and plants
	2. A pattern defined by extremely high death rates for larvae or seedlings, but high survival rates for individuals that make is past this stage


![[Pasted image 20250410140819.png|600]]

Fecundiy
- In the fourth column shows data for fecundity

**Fecundity** - The average number of female offspring produced by a single female in the course of her lifetime

**Age-specific fecundity** - The average number of female offspring produced by a female in a certain age class

- Older female lizards have a higher age-specific fecundity than younger females


Reproductive Rate
- If survivorship is higher in young lizards and fecundity is higher in older lizards, most of the offspring in the population are produced by females of intermediate age
- The sum of the purple bar is a measure of net reproductive rate

**Net reproductive rate** ($R_0$) - The growth rate of a population per generation, equivalent to the average number of female offspring that each female produces over her lifetime 

- The sum is equal to 1, then the population is stable
- When the sum is > 1, the population is increasing
- When the sum is < 1, the population is decreasing

![[Pasted image 20250410141411.png|500]]

- Tyrannosaur has a modified Type II survivorship curve
- High newborn mortality was followed by low juvenile mortality
- Mortality increased as the dinosaurs reached reproductive maturity


# The Role of Life History

- In the Netherlands almost no 1-year-old female reproduced
- In Brittany, France, 50% if 1-year-old female reproduced
- In the mountains of Australia females don't begin breeding until they are 4 years old

- In this species, key aspects of the life table vary dramatically among populations located in different abiotic and biotic environments


What Are Fitness Trade-Offs?

**Fitness trade-offs** - In evolutionary biology, an inescapable compromise between two traits that cannot be optimized simultaneously

- Lizard females do not have both high fecundity and high survival
- Every individual has a restricted amount of time and energy at is disposal

# Using Life Table to Calculate Population Growth Rates

$l_x$ = survivorship
$x$ = age class
$N_x$ = Number of females in age class $x$
$N_0$ = Number of original females


Survivorship: $l_x = \frac{N_x}{N_0}$

$m_x$ = Age specific fecundity
$l_xm_x$ = average number of female offspring produced by females during each age of life

$(0.308)(1.47) = 0.453$

0.308 is the frequency of survivorship at age 2
1.47 is the average offspring of a 2 year old

Net reproductive rate: $R_0 = \sum^{x}_{i = 0}{l_xm_x}$

If $R_0$ is > 1, then the population is increasing
If $R_0$ is < 1, then the population is declining


Ex. Calculate the population of the fish

![[Pasted image 20250410142923.png|100]]

Net reproductive rate: $R_0 = {(0.650)(0.00)}+{(0.520)(0.15)}+{(0.225)(1.65)}+{(0.005)(3.50)} = 0.47$

Therefore, the population is declining


Life History Patterns Result from Fitness Trade-Offs

**Life history** - The sequence of events in an individual's life from birth to reproduction to death, including how an individual allocates resources to growth, reproduction, and activities or structures that are related to survival

- In almost all cases, biologists find that life history is shaped by natural selection in a way that maximizes an individual's fitness in its environment
- Life patterns are adaptive in certain conditions
- Female lizards who live a long time but mature late and have few offspring each year have a high fitness in cold, high elevation habitats
- In warm, low-elevation habitats, females who have short lives but mature early and have large number of offspring each year do better

![[Pasted image 20250410143458.png|400]]

- Evolutionary change occurs in populations, not organisms
- Evolution is not goal directed
- Evolution does not perfect organisms


Life-History Patterns Vary across Species
- In general, individuals from species with high fecundity tend to grow quickly, reach sexual maturity at a young age, and produce many small eggs or seeds
- The mustard plant germinates and grow to sexual maturity in just 4 to 6 weeks
- The species only lives a few months but may produce as many as 10000 seeds
- Fruit flies, rabbits, guppies, and dandelions have similar life-history patterns
- Individuals with high survivorship tend to grow slowly and invest resources in traits that reduce damage from enemies and increase their own ability to compete
- Trait in coconut palms increase survivorship but decrease fecundity

![[Pasted image 20250410151705.png|400]]

Applying Life-History Data to Solve Problems
- The life-history continuum is a framework that helps biologists solve problems such as the conservation of endangered species or the containment of invasive species
	- Which life stages are conservation priorities?
		- Eggs and nesting sites are most important so saving endangered sea turtles
	- Can variation in life history strategies within a population protect it against environmental variability?
		- There is 36 different life-history variants in Skeena and Nass stealhead fish
	- Where do invasive species lie on the life-history continuum?
		- Invasive species have a variety of life-history patterns
		- Invasive species have adaptive capacity, sufficient genetic variation in life-history traits to evolve quickly in new habitats
	- How are species affect by climate change?
		- Climate change has reduced the thickness of insulating snow layer at high elevations

**Anadromy** - A fish is born in fresh water, matures in saltwater, and returns to fresh water to spawn


# ==51.3 - Population Growth==

---
- 4 processes affect population sizes
	- Birth
	- Immigration
	- Death
	- Emigration
- Population overall growth rate, or change in population size ($\Delta N$) per unit time ($\Delta t$), is a function of birth rates, death rates, immigration rates, and emigrations rates

$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = Births - Deaths + Immigrants - Emigrants$


With no immigration or emigrations

$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = Births - Deaths$


# Exponential Growth

An Exponential Growth Equation

- If there is no immigration or emigrations, the population's growth rate is equal to the number if individuals (N) in the population times the difference between the birth rate per individual (b) and death rate per individual (d)


$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = (b - d)N$

- The difference between brith rate and death rate per individual is the _per capita rate of increase_

**Per capita rate of increase (r)** - Also called instantaneous rate of increate. The difference between the birth rate per individual and the death rate per individual

$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = rN$


- If b > d, then r > 0 and population is growing
- If b < d, then r < 0 and population is declining
- If b < d, then r = 0 and population is not changing

- Differential calculus can be used to create an expression for instantaneous growth rate

$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$

**Exponential population growth** - The accelerating increase in the size of a population that occurs when the per capita growth rate is constant and density independent

- Exponential population growth, occurs when _r_ is grater than zero, and the instantaneous growth rate increases as population size N increases due to the produce of r time N
- When _r_ reaches a maximal value it is the _intrinsic rate of increase_

**Intrinsic rate of increase ($r_{max}$)** - The rate of increase of a population when conditions are ideal (birth rates per individual are as high as possible and death rates per individuals are as low as possible)

- For fruit flies $r_{max}$ is high
- For coconut palms $r_{max}$ is low
- $r_{max}$ is a function of a species' life-history traits
- Each species has a characteristic $r_{max}$ that does not change
- $r$ is the instantaneous growth rate, and represents the rate at a point in time
- Therefore, $r$ <= $r_{max}$
- As long as r is greater than 0, then growth increases exponentially when resources are unlimited


# Using Growth Models to Predict Population Growth

- The per capita (or instantaneous) rate of increase, r, is related to the net reproductive rate, $R_0$
- r can be estimated from life-table data

$r = \frac{lnR_0}{g}$


For Species that breed continuously (humans and bacteria)
![[Pasted image 20250414121307.png|300]]

e = 2.72

Ex.
_If 10 rats were introduced from a ship onto the Island $N_0 = 10$ and the $r$ for rats is about 0.015, therefore the predicted rate population in one year is about 2400 (rounded from 2386)_

For Species with Non Continuous Growth (Insects and plants)

**Finite rate of increase (lambda)** - The rate of increase of a population over a given period of time. Calculated as the ending population size divided by the starting population size. Compare with intrinsic rate of increase and per capita rate of increase

Graphing Exponential Growth
![[Pasted image 20250414121921.png|500]]


Exponential Growth Is Density Independent

**Density independent** - In population ecology, referring to any characteristic that does not vary with population density

- Population growth is density independent
- Exponential growth is common in 2 types of circumstances
	- Colonization of a new habitat
	- Recovery after a disaster


# Logistic Growth

- Growth is density dependent

**Density dependent** - In population ecology, referring to any characteristic that varies depending on population density

**Carrying capacity (K)** - The maximum population size of a certain species that a given habitat can support


A Logistic Growth Equation

**Logistic population growth** - The density-dependent decrease in growth rate as population size approaches the carrying capacity

Density-dependent growth = $\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(\frac{K-N}{K})$

- This expression is called a logistic growth equation
- (K - N)/K described the proportion of "unused resources and space" in the habitat
- When N is small, then (K - N)/K is close to 1 and the growth rate should be high
- As N gets larger, the growth rate decreases
- When N is at carrying capacity, then (K - N)/K is equal to 0, and growth stops


Graphing Logistic Growth

![[Pasted image 20250414122933.png|400]]

![[Pasted image 20250414122945.png|400]]


# What Factors Limit Population Size?

- Population sizes are regulated by 2 general types of factors
	- Density-independent factors
		- Changes in the abiotic environment
	- Density-dependent factors
		- Usually biotic

Density-Dependent Factors Limit Population Size
- Responsible for the declining growth rates in logistic population growth

![[Pasted image 20250414123351.png|400]]

![[Pasted image 20250414123420.png|400]]

- Crowded population can also be more vulnerable to infectious disease and parasites, exposure to a buildup of toxic waste, increased predation rates, and crowd-induced behavioural changes that decrease the probability that individuals will survive and produce viable offspring


Carrying Capacity Is Not Fixed and Can Be Overshot
- Logistic growth model assumes a constant K
- In reality, K changes over time due to fluctuations in food availability, space, and other density-dependent factors

# ==51.4 - Population Dynamics==

---

**Population dynamics** - Changes in the size and other characteristic of populations through time and space

# Why Do Some Populations Crash?
- After 40 reindeer were placed on the island in 1911 as a food source for people, the population grew exponentially to more than 2000 animals in 30 years
- 12 years later, only eight were left

![[Pasted image 20250410155518.png|400]]

- Several variables
	- Density-independent
		- Harsh winters
	- Density-dependent
		- Disease and hunting
- Key cause of the crash was over-foraging of the food supply
- The reindeer consumed the lichen and plants at the unsustainable rate
- From food availability the carrying capacity on the Island was 1/3 of the maximum population size reached, about 700 reindeer, if they had not overexploited their food reserves

# Why Do Some Populations Cycle?
- Population cycles has been a productive way to understand how intraspecific and interspecific density-dependent factors interact
- The x-axis is a 50-year interval
- The y-axis shows changes in hare population density and changes in lynx density

![[Pasted image 20250410160012.png|600]]

- The scales on the y-axis are different, the hare is logarithmic to compress the values
- The hare and lynx populations cycle every 10 years on average
- Change in lynx density lag behind changes in hare density by about two years


Is It Food or Predation?
- 2 hypotheses based on density-dependent factors
	- Bottom-up hypothesis
		- When their populations reach high density, hares use up all their food and starve, in response, lynx also starve
	- Top-down hypothesis
		- Lynx populations reach high density in response to increases in hare density
		- At high density, lynx eat so many hares that they prey population crashes

- Either hares control lynx population size, or vice versa
- The cycle could be controlled by intraspecific competition for food or interspecific interactions, or an interaction of both factors

A Field Experiment
- Hare populations are limited by both predation and food availability
- When predation and food limitation occur together, they have a greater effect than either factor does independently

![[Pasted image 20250410160537.png|600]]

- The biologists use the mark-recapture method and radio collars to monitor the size of the hare and lynx populations over an 8-period
- Recent climate models suggest that density-independent factors, such as temperature, rainfall, and snow, may interact with density-dependent factors, such as the concentration of defence compounds in plants, to influence the hare-lynx cycles

# How Do Meta-populations Change through Time?

![[Pasted image 20250414124105.png|400]]

- The overall size of this metapopulation stays relatively stable even if individual populations go extinct
- These populations may be restored by dispersal, or unoccupied habitats might be colonized

Model Predications: Meta-populations Should Be Dynamic

- Given enough time, each population within the larger metapopulation is expected to go extinct
- This cause could be catastrophe, such as a storm
- Dispersal from nearby populations can re-establish populations in empty habitat fragments
- Even though populations blink on and off over time, the overall metapopulation is maintained at a stable number of individuals

An Experimental Test
- History and future of a metapopulation are driven by the birth and death of populations, just as the dynamics of a single population are driven by the birth and death of individuals
- Dispersal is important source of individuals to recolonize patches of vacated habitats

Meta-population Dynamics Are Important to Conservation
- 4 attributed of Glanville fritillary (butterfly) subpopulation that increase their likelihood to presist
	- They have larger subpopulation sizes
	- They occupy larger geographical ranges
	- They are closer to neighbouring subpopulations
	- They have higher genetic diversity

# ==51.5 - Case Study: Human Population Growth==

---

# Age Structure in Human Populations

Age Pyramids

- In countries where industrial and technological development took place, survivorship has been high and fecundity low for several decades
- Developing nations have a bottom heavy distribution because they are undergoing rapid growth

![[Pasted image 20250414154056.png|500]]

- How to care for an increasingly aged population
- Providing education and jobs for an enormous group of young people who will be reaching adulthood during the lifetimes of preceding generations

Population "Momentum"
- In Honduras the survivorship is high, although the fecundity is expected to decline
- These populations now contain so many young women that the overall number of births will stay high, even through the average number of children per female is much lower than it was a generation ago

# Analyzing Change in the Growth Rate of Human Populations

![[Pasted image 20250414202816.png|400]]


How Large Is the Current Human Population?
- Humans are the primary cause of habitat loss and species extinction, overpopulation is linked by researchers to declines in living standards, mass movements of people, political instability, and acute shortages of water, fuel, and other basic resources
- Humans population has already peaked and begun to slow
- The current growth rate is 1.09% per year

Will Human Population Size Peak in Your Lifetime?
- UN projections are based on 3 scenarios
	- Fertility rates
		- 2.5 (high)
		- 2.0 (medium)
		- 1.5 (low)

![[Pasted image 20250414203212.png|400]]


**Fertility** - The average number of surviving children that each woman has during her lifetime

**Replacement rate** - the number of offspring each female must produce over her entire life to "replace" herself and her mate, resulting in zero population growth. The actual number is slightly more than two because some offspring die before reproducing

**Zero population growth** - A state of stable population size due to fertility staying at the replacement rate for at least one generation

- The replacement rate of the population is 2.1

# Take-Home Messages
- The human population boom is central to the population ecology of other organisms because the growing human population dramatically affects them via habitat, pollution, over-harvesting or resources, and climate change
