**Community** - All the populations of different species that interact with each other in a certain area


# ==52.1 - Species Interactions==

---

- Biologists begin by analyzing the effects of one species on the fitness of another

**Fitness** - the ability of an individual to produce viable offspring relative to others of the same species

4 Common Types of Interactions
1. Commensalism (+/0)
2. Competition (-/-)
3. Consumption (+/-)
4. Mutualism (+/+)

**Commensalism** - A species relationship in which one organism (the commensal) benefits and the other (the host) is unaffected

**Competition** - In ecology, the interaction of two species or two individuals trying to use the same limited resource. May occur between individuals of the same species (intraspecific competition) or different species (interspecific competition)

**Consumption** - In ecology, the interaction between species where one organism eats or absorbs nutrients from another. Includes predation, herbivory, and parasitism

3 Key Themes
1) Species interaction can affect the distribution and abundance of a particular species
2) Species act as agents of natural selection when they interact
3) The outcome of interactions among species is dynamic and conditions

**Coevolution** - A patten of evolution in which two interacting species reciprocally influence each other's adaptations over time

# Species Interaction: Commensalism

- Commensalism has been found in the fossils of the Burgess Shale
- The brachiopod (shale), whose mobile host harried it above the sediment and gave it access to an increased food supply
- In turn the host would be unharmed
- A modern example is the relationship between epiphytic orchids and their host trees
- Orchids absorb most of the water and nutrients they need from rainwater, insect feces, dust, and other particles
- Epiphytes benefit by being held aloft in the sunlight, but the fitness of the tree is neither increased nor reduced
- Although some orchids population the branches of the tree, the the relationship becomes competitive


# Species Interaction: Competition
- Foraging, finding mates, reproducing, all increase fitness
- Intraspecific competition is a major reason that a population's growth is density dependent


**Intraspecific competition** - Competition between members of the same species for the same limited resource

**Competition** - In ecology, the interaction of two species of two individual trying to use the same limited resource (ex. water, food, living space)
- May occur between individuals of the same species (infraspecific competition) or different species (interspecific competition)

*Using the Niche Concept to Analyze Interspecific Competition*

**Interspecific competition** - Competition between members of different species for the same limited resource

**Niche** - The range of resource that a species can use and the range of condition that it can tolerate; more broadly, the role that a species plays in its ecosystem

- A niche could be envisions by plotting a species' habitat requirements along a series of axes, such as the species' food or temperature requirements




*What Happens When Complete Niche Overlap Occurs?*


**Competitive exclusion principle** - The principle that two species cannot coexist in the same ecological niche in the same area because one species will outcompete the other


*What Happens When Partial Niche Overlap Occurs?*

**Fundamental niche** - The total theoretical range of environmental condition that a species can tolerate

**Realized niche** - The portion of the fundamental niche that a species actually occupies given limiting factors such as competition with other species



*Experimental Studies of Competition in Nature*





*Fitness Trade-Offs in Competition*


**Fitness trade-offs** - In evolutionary biology, an inescapable compromise between two traits that cannot be optimized simultaneously


*Mechanisms of Coexistence: Niche Differentiation*


**Niche differentiation** - The evolutionary change in resource use by competing species that occurs as the result of character displacement

**Character displacement** - The evolutionary tendency for the traits of similar species that occupy overlapping ranges to change in a way that reduced interspecific competition


# Species Interaction: Consumption



**Predation** - The killing and eating of one organism (the prey) by another (the predator)

**Herbivory** - The practice of eating plant tissues

**Parasitism** - A relationship between two organisms that is beneficial to one organisms (the parasite) and detrimental, but usually not fatal, to the other (the host)
- Parasites are usually small relative to the host and consume relatively small amount of tissue or nutrients



*Consumption Interactions Can Affect the Distribution and Abundance of Species*

**Integrated pest management** - In agriculture or forestry, systems for managing insects or other pests that include carefully controlled applications of toxins, introduction of species that prey on pests, planting schemes that reduce the change of a severe pest outbreak, and other techniques



*Consumption Is an Agent of Natural Selection*


**Coevolutionary arms race** - A series of adaptation and counter-adaptation observed in species that interact closely over time and affect each other's fitness

*Constitutive Defences Are Present in the Absence of Consumers*

**Constitutive defences** - A defence trait that is always manifested even in the absence of a predator or pathogen

**Mimicry** - A phenomenon in which one species has evolved (or learns) to look or sound like another speices

**Batesian mimicry** - A type of mimicry in which a harmless or palatable species resembles a dangerous or poisonous species

**Mullerian mimicry** - A type of mimicry in which two (or more) harmful species resemble each other






*Inducible Defences Are Produced Following Exposure to Consumers*

**Inducible defences** - A defensive trait that is manifested only in response to the presence of a consumer (predator or herbivore) or pathogen



*Parasite-Host Coevolution Can Be Particularly Complex*




# Species Interaction: Mutualism

**Symbiosis ("together living")** - Any close and prolonged physical relationship between individuals of two different species



*Mutualists Are Not Trying to Be "Nice"*





*Mutualisms Are Context Dependent*





*Mutualisms Can Be Specific or General*

# How Many Species Occur in Communities?

**Species richness** - The number of species present in a given ecological community

**Species diversity** - The variety and relative abundance of the species present in a given ecological community





# How Do Species Interactions Form Networks?

**Food chain** - A relatively simple pathway of energy flow through a few species, each at a different tropic level, in an ecosystem
- Primary producer, primary consumer, secondary consumer, and a decomposer

**Food web** - The complex network of interactions among species in an ecosystem formed by the transfer of energy and nutrients among trophic levels





# Why Are Some Species More Important than Others in Structuring Communities?

**Keystone species** - A species that has an exceptionally great impact on the other species in its ecosystem relative to its abundance



*Top-Down Influences on Community Structure*

**Trophic cascade** - A series of change in the abundance of species in a food web, usually caused by the addition or removal or a key predator

**Landscape of fear**

# Disturbance and Change in Ecological Communities

**Disturbance** - In ecology, any strong, short-lived distribution to a community that changes the distribution of living and/or nonliving resources


**Disturbance regime** - The characteristic disturbances that affect a given ecological community

# Succession: The Development of Communities after Disturbance

**Succession** - In ecology, the gradual colonization of a habitat after an environmental disturbance, usually by a series of species

**Primary succession** - The gradual colonization of a habitat of bare rock or gravel, usually after an environmental disturbance that removes all soil and previous organisms

**Secondary succession** - Gradual colonization of a habitat after an environmental disturbance that removes some or all previous organisms but leaves the soil intact



*The Role of Species Traits*

**Pioneering species** - Those species that appear first in recently distributed areas

**Weed** - Any plant that is adapted for growth in disturbed soils



*The Role of Species Interactions*

**Facilitation** - In ecological succession, the phenomenon in which early arriving species make condition more favourable for later arriving species

**Tolerance** - In ecological succession, the phenomenon in which early arriving species do not affect the probability that subsequent species will become established

**Inhibition** - In ecological succession, the phenomenon in which early arriving species makes conditions less favourable for the establishment of certain later arriving species
