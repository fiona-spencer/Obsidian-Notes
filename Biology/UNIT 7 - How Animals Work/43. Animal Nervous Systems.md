# 43.1 - Principle of Electrical Signalling

---

Nerve net - A nervous system in which neurons are diffuse instead of being clustered into large ganglia or tract; found in cnidarians and ctenophores

Central nervous system (CNS) - An aggregation of large number of neurons into clusters called ganglia in bilaterian animals. In vertebrates, the CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord

# Types of Neurons

Sensory neurons - A nerve cell that carries sensory signal to the central nervous system

Interneurons - A neuron that passes signals from one neuron to another

Motor neurons - A nerve cell that carries signals from the central nervous system to effector cells in a muscle or gland

Nerves - A long strand of nervous tissue containing axons wrapped in connective tissue; carries signals between the central nervous system and some other part of the body

Peripheral nervous system (PNS) - All the components of a nervous system are outside the central nervous system. In vertebrates, includes the somatic nervous system and autonomic nervous system

Reflex - An involuntary response to an environmental stimulus

# The Anatomy of a Neuron

Cell body/soma - The part of a neuron that contains the nucleus; where incoming signals are integrated

Dendrites - A short extension from a neuron's cell body that receives signal from other neurons

Axons - A long projection of a neuron that can propagate an action potential

# An Introduction to Membrane Potentials

Electrical potential/Voltage - Potential energy created by a separation of electrical charges between two points


Units and Signs

Electrical Potential, Electric Currents, and Electrical Gradients

# How Is the Resting Potential Maintained?

The Role of the K+ Leak Channel

# Using Electrodes to Measure Membrane Potentials

# What Is an Action Potential?

A Three-Phase Signal

An "All-or-None" Signal That Propagates

# Distinct Ion Currents Are Responsible for Depolarization and Repolarization

# How Do Voltage-Gated Channels Work?

Patch Clamping and Studies of Single Channels

Positive Feedback Occurs during Depolarization

Using Neurotoxins to Identify Channels and Dissect Currents

Neurotoxins - Any substance that specifically destroy or blocks the normal functioning of neurons

# How Is the Action Potential Propagated?

Axon Diameter Affected Speed

Myelination Affects Speed



# 43.3 - The Synapse

---

Synapses - The interface between two neurons or between a neuron and an effector cell

Neurotransmitters - A molecule that transmits signals from one neuron to another neuron or to a muscle cell or gland cell
- Acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline

# Synapse Structure and Neurotransmitter Release

# What Do Neurotransmitters Do?

Ligand-gates channels - An ion channel that opens in response to binding by a certain molecule

A non-protein signalling molecule produced or activated inside a cell in response to stimulation at the cell surface

# Postsynaptic Potentials

Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) - A depolarization of a cell that makes the cell more likely to generate an action potential

Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) - A change in membrane potential, usually hyper-polarization, of a cell that makes the cell less likely to generate an action potential

Postsynaptic Potentials Are Graded

# What Does the Peripheral Nervous System Do?

Afferent division - The part of the nervous system that transmits information about the internal and external environment to the central nervous system

Efferent division - The part of the nervous system that carries commands from the central nervous system to the rest of the body. Consists primarily of motor neurons

Somatic nervous system - The part of the vertebrate peripheral nervous system that controls skeletal muscles and is under voluntary control

Autonomic nervous system - The part of the vertebrate peripheral nervous system that controls internal organs and involuntary processes, such as stomach contraction, hormone release, and heart rate

Parasympathetic nervous system - The part of the autonomic nervous system that triggers responses for conserving or restoring energy, such as reduced heart rate and stimulated digestion

Sympathetic nervous system - The part of the autonomic nervous system that stimulates flight or flight responses, such as increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and slowed digestion

Enteric nervous system - A network of neurons embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates


# Functional Anatomy of the CNS

General Anatomy of the Human Brain

Cerebrum - The most anterior portion of the vertebrate brain; divided into left and right hemispheres and four lobes

Diencephalon - The part of the mammalian brain that relays sensory information to the cerebrum and functions in maintaining homeostasis

Brainstem - The most posterior portion of the vertebrate brain, connection to the spinal cord and responsible for autonomic body functions such as regulating heart rate, respiration, and digestion

Cerebellum - A posterior portion of the vertebrate brain; involved in coordination of complex muscle movements, such as those required for locomotion and maintaining balance
