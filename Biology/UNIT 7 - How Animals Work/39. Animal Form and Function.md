Anatomy - The physical structure of organisms

Physiology - How an organism's body functions


# 39.1 - Form, Function, and Adaptation

---

Adaptations - Any heritable trait that increases the fitness of an individual with that trait, compared with individuals without that trait, in a particular environment


# The Role of Fitness Trade-Offs

# Adaptation and Acclimatization

Acclimatization - A change in an individual's phenotype that occurs in response to a change in natural environment conditions
