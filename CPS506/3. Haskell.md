# Functional Programming

High-order functions:
- Can return functions or accept them as arguments

First class functions:
- Can be passed as arguments, returned as values
- Think of them as values, just like integers or floats

Pure Functions:
- Functions that have no side effects
- No interaction with word outside of local scope
- Easier to verify correctness, thread-safe when no data dependency is present

Strict (eager) vs Non-strict (lazy) Evaluation:
- Strict
	- Evaluate function arguments before invoking the function
- Lazy
	- Evaluates arguments if their value is required to invoke the function

# History of Haskell

- Named after logician Haskell Curry
- Late 80s, interest in lazy functional languages was growing
- Strong consensus to design an open standard for such languages

Purely Functional:
- Every function is _pure_
- No statement, only expression
- Cannot mutate variable (local or global)
- Supports pattern matching
- Even side-effect inducing operations are produced by pure code
- Side effects are handled using _monads_

Statically Typed:
- Every expression has a type
	- Determined at compile time
- Type composing expression must match
	- If not, compile error

Type Inference:
- Type do no have to be written out explicitly
- They will be inferred at compile time

Lazy Evalution:
- Functions do not evaluate their arguments
- Expressions bound to variable do not evaluate unless the result is used
- Computation never takes place unless a result is used

Concurrency:
- GHG (Haskell compiler) includes high performance parallel garbage collector
- Light-weight concurrency library


# Companies

- Nvidia
- AT&T
- Ericsson
- Facebook
- Google
- Intel
- Microsoft

- Haskell is used on specialized internal projects or research
- Interactive shell: `ghci`
- `main()` is the entry point of a Haskell program
- Compile: `ghc simple.hs -o simple`

```Haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

- Operator precedence is as expected
- Division yields floating point
- No parentheses on function calls

`sqrt 2`

- `^` can be used for exponentiation
- Supports tuples, do not need to contain the same type
- There are built in function for accessing first and second elements

```haskell
fst (5, "hello") -- 5
snd (5, "hello") -- "hello"
```

- `fst` and `snd` only work on pair tuples

# Lists

- List must be homogeneous
- Integer literals get inferred as floating point
- Characters do not
- Elements can be added to the beginning of a list with the **cons (:)** operator

```haskell
0:[1, 2] -- [0,1,2]
0:1:2:3:4:[] -- [0,1,2,3,4]
```

- List does not include spaces after commas
- Build a list using cons operator and an empty list
- The compiler is reading in cons form, and `[1,2,3]` notation is syntactic sugar

# Tuples

- Tuples can be heterogeneous, list must be homogeneous
- We can have lists of tuples, where each tuple is heterogeneous

```
[(1,'a'), (2,'b'), (3,'c')]
```

- In a list of tuples, each tuple must have the same format

# Strings

- Strings are a list of characters
- We can cons chars into an empty list to form a string
- Concatenate lists using ++ operator

`"Hello, " ++ "World!"`

- Cannot concatenate different types
- `show()` and `read()` functions, converts a non-string to a string, and vice versa, respectively

```haskell
"The number is" ++ show 5 -- "The number is 5"
read "506" - 6 -- 500
```

# Operations on Lists

- In functional programming, computation is done in large part by operating on lists
- We saw the `hd, tl, |, and Enum` in Elixir
- Haskell has a similar set of operations
- 3 primary list-processing functions
	- `map`
	- `filter`
	- `foldr/foldl`

# Head and Tail

- Head returns the first element
- Tail returns the rest, as a list
- Boundary cases:
	- Single element lists
	- Empty lists

```haskell
head [1,, 2, 3] -- [1]
tail [1, 2, 3] -- [2,3]
head [1] -- 1
tail [1] -- []
```


# Map

```haskell
map Data.Char.toUpper "Hello, World!"
"HELLO, WORLD!"
```

- First class function
- Alphabetical characters are upped, everything else is left the same
- Map operates on lists, but string is just a list of characters
- Map takes two arguments
	- A function
	- A List

# Filter

- Removes items from a list based on some criteria

```haskell
filter Data.Char.isLower "Hello, World!"
"elloorld"
```

# Infix Functions

- Use symbolic operations as functions
- Enclose in parentheses to use in non-infix mode

```haskell
(+) 5 10
15
(*) 5 10
50
(/) 5 10
0.5
```


# Fold

- Replaces the cons operator with some other function

foldr
- Replaces the cons operator with another function of our choosing
- Similar to `Enum.reduce` in Elixir
- The empty list is replaced with some initial value
- Takes a:
	- Function, initial value, list

```haskell
foldr (+) 0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
foldr (+) 0 1:2:3:4:5:[]
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0
15
foldr (*) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -- factorial
120
```

# Foldl vs Foldr

- `foldr` is right associative
- `foldl` is left associative

```haskell
foldr (-) 0 [1, 2, 3]
(1 - (2 - (3 - 0)))
(1 - (2 - (3)))
(1 - (-1))
2

foldl (-) 0 [1, 2, 3]
(((0 - 1) - 2) - 3)
(((-1) - 2) - 3)
(((-3) - 3)
-6
```


# List Generation

List declaration: `list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Range: `list = [1..5]`
Range with interval: `list = [1,3..9] = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

- Interval is discerned from difference between first two elements

Infinite lists
- We bind x to the expression to generate an infinite list
- We do not have to evaluate this list to do so
- Displaying the list, however requires evaluation

```haskell
```
