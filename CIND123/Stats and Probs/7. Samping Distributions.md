# 7.2 - Sampling Plans and Experimental Designs

---

**Stratified random sampling** - involved selecting a simple random sample from each of a given number of subpopulations, or strata

**Cluster sample** - a simple random sample of clusters from the available clusters in the population

**1-in-$k$ systematic random sample** - random selection of one of the first $k$ elements in an ordered population, and then the systematic selection of every $k$th element thereafter
# 7.3 - Statistic and Sampling Distributions

---

**Sampling distribution of a statistic** - the probability distribution for the possible values of the statistic that results when random samples of size $n$ are repeatedly drawn from the population
