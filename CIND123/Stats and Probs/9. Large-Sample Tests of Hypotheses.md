**Type I error** - the error or rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true
**Level of significance (significance level)** -


# 9.3 - A Large-Sample Test about a Population Mean

---
**p-value** - the smallest value of a for which $H_0$ can be rejected

**Statistically significant** - if the p-value is less than or equal to a preassigned significance level a, then the null hypothesis can be rejected, and you can report that the result at level a

**Type II error** - the error of accepting the null hypothesis when it is false and some alternative hypothesis is true
