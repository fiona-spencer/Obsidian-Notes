# 2.1 - Describing a Set of Data with Numerical Measures

---

- Graphs are only useful through visual representation
- Graphs are somewhat imprecise for use in statistical inferences

- Numerical descriptive measures associated with a population of measurements are called **parameters**, those computed from sample measurements are called. **statistics**


# 2.2 - Measures of Centre

---
**Measure of centre** - a measure along the horizontal axis that locates the centre of the distribution

$((9.4 - 5.6) /2 ) + 5.6 = 7.5$

- The centre of the histogram is in the vicinity of 7.5

**Arithmetic mean/average** - a set of $n$ measurements is equal to the sum of the measurements divided by $n$

**$x̄$** - sample mean
**$µ$** - population mean


Summation:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_n
$$
Sample Mean:

$x̄ = \frac{\sum{x_i}}{n}$

Population Mean: $µ$


Example
$n = 5$ measurements 2, 9, 11, 5, 6
_Find the sample mean and compare its value with the "centre"_

$x̄ = \frac{2+9+11+5+6}{6} = 6.6$


Therefore, the sample mean is $x̄ = 6.6$, $n$ measurements
