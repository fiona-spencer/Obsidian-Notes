**Sample** - A subset of the population, selected for analysis
**Population** - The entire group of a specified number of measurements or data

Ex. Body Temperature
- Sample - 148 healthy people
- Population - entire world population

- A sample is used to predict the behaviour of the population on the basis of information obtained from a representative sample from that population

**Experimental units/Elements of the sample** - the objects on which measurements are taken

## Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
- Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that present techniques for describing sets of measurements
- Bar charts, pie charts, and line charts
- Consist of procedures used to summarize and describe the important characteristics of a set of measurements

**Inferential statistics** - consists of procedures used to make inferences about population characteristics from information contained in a sample drawn from this population


## Steps of Achieving the Objective of Inferential Statistics
1) Specify the questions to be answered and identify the population of interest
2) Decide how to select the sample
	- Design of the experiment
	- Sampling procedure
3) Select the sample and analyze the sample information
4) Use the information from step 3 to make an inference about the population
5) Determine the reliability of inference

# 1.1 - Variables and Data

---

**Variable** - A characteristic that changes or varies over time and/or for different individuals or objects under consideration
- Body temperature

**Experimental unit** - the individual or object on which a variable is measures
**Measurement/data** - the value resulted when a variable is actually measured on an experiment unit

**Population** - the set of all measurements of interest of the investigator
**Sample** - a subset of measurements selected from the population of interest
