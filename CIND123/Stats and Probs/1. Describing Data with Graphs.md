**Sample** - A subset of the population, selected for analysis
**Population** - The entire group of a specified number of measurements or data

Ex. Body Temperature
- Sample - 148 healthy people
- Population - entire world population

- A sample is used to predict the behaviour of the population on the basis of information obtained from a representative sample from that population

**Experimental units/Elements of the sample** - the objects on which measurements are taken

## Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
- Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that present techniques for describing sets of measurements
- Bar charts, pie charts, and line charts
- Consist of procedures used to summarize and describe the important characteristics of a set of measurements

**Inferential statistics** - consists of procedures used to make inferences about population characteristics from information contained in a sample drawn from this population


## Steps of Achieving the Objective of Inferential Statistics
1) Specify the questions to be answered and identify the population of interest
2) Decide how to select the sample
	- Design of the experiment
	- Sampling procedure
3) Select the sample and analyze the sample information
4) Use the information from step 3 to make an inference about the population
5) Determine the reliability of inference

# 1.1 - Variables and Data

---

**Variable** - A characteristic that changes or varies over time and/or for different individuals or objects under consideration
- Body temperature

**Experimental unit** - the individual or object on which a variable is measures
**Measurement/data** - the value resulted when a variable is actually measured on an experiment unit

**Population** - the set of all measurements of interest of the investigator
**Sample** - a subset of measurements selected from the population of interest

Example -

![](Pasted%20image%2020250510135732.png)

Experimental unit - Student (C1)
Variables
1. GPA (numerical)
2. Gender (non-numerical)
3. Year (non-numerical)
4. Major (non-numerical)
5. Number of units (numerical)

- The measurements consist of 5 observation
- All 5 variables on a single experimental unit

**Univariate data** - result when a single variable is measured on a single experimental unit

**Bivariate data** - result when two variables are measured on a single experimental unit
**Multivariate data** - result when more than two variables are measured


# 1.2 - Types of Variables

---

**Qualitative variables** - measure a quality or characteristic on each experimental unit
**Quantitative variables** - measure a numerical quantity or amount on each experimental unit

- Qualitative variables are often called _categorical data_
- Quantitative variables, produce numerical data

**Discrete variable** - can assume only a finite of countable number of values
**Continuous variable** - can assume the infinitely many values corresponding to the points on a line interval

# 1.3 - Graphs for Categorical Data

---

- A _statistical table_ is used to display the data graphically as a data distribution

## Qualitative Data
- Frequency
- Relative frequency
- Percentage

$Relative frequency = \frac{frequency}{n}$

$Percent = 100$ x $relative frequency$

- Sum of the frequencies is a $n$
- Sum of relative frequencies is 1
- Sum of percentages is $100\%$

- A measurement will belong to one and only one category
- Each measurement has a category to which it can be assigned

Pie Chart

$Angle = Relative frequency$ x $360Â°$

## Pareto Chart
- A bar chart in which the bars are ordered form largest to smallest

# 1.4 - Graphs for Quantitative Data

---

- Quantitative variables measure an amount or quantity on each experimental unit


## Pie Charts and Bar Charts

![](Pasted%20image%2020250510141940.png)

- 2 variables
	- Category of expenditure (_qualitative_)
	- Amount of expenditure (quantitative)
