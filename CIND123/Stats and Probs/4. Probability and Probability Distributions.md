# 4.1 - The Role of Probability in Statistics

---
# 4.2 - Events and the Sample Space

---

**Experiement** - the process by which an observation (or measurement) is obtained

**Simple event** - the outcome that is observed on a single repetition of the experiment

**Event** - a collection of simple events

**Mutually exclusive** - when one event occurs, the others cannot, and vice versa

**Sample space $(S)$** - the set of all simple events

# 4.3 - Calculating Probabilities Using Simple Events

---

**Probability of an event $A$** - equal to the sun of the probabilities of the simple events contained in $A$



# 4.4 - Useful Counting Rules

---
# 4.5 - Event Relations and Probability Rules

---

- The **union** of events $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A âˆª B$, is the event that either $A$ or $B$ or both occur

- The **intersection** of events A and B, denoted by A B, is the event that both A and B occur

- The **complement** of an event A, denoted by $A^c$, is the event that A does not occur

# 4.6 - Independence, Conditional Probability, and the Multiplication Rule

---

- Two events, A and B, are said to be independent if and only if the probability of event B is not influenced or changed by the occurrence of event A, or vice versa

# 4.7 - Bayes' Rule

---
# 4.8 - Discrete Random Variable and Their Probability Distribution

---

- A variable $x$ is a random variable if the value that it assumes, corresponding to the outcome of an experiment, is a chance or random event


- The probability distribution for a discrete random variable is a formula, table, or graph that gives the possible values of x, and the probability p(x) associated with each value of x
