- A _matrix_ is a vector with two additional attributes
	- Number of rows
	- Number of columns
- Arrays can be multi-dimensional consisting of rows, columns, and layers

# 3.1 - Creating Matrices

- Matrix row and column subscripts being with 1
- Upper-left corner of matrix `a` is denoted `a[1,1]`
- The internal storage of a matrix is column-major order
	- First column is stores, then the next

```R
> y <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4),nrow=2,ncol=2)
> y
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 3
[2,] 2 4
```

- R shows notation for rows and columns
	- `[rows,columns]`

```R
> y[,2]
[1] 3 4
```


- Another way to specify elements

```R
> y <- matrix(nrow=2,ncol=2)
> y[1,1] <- 1
> y[2,1] <- 2
> y[1,2] <- 3
> y[2,2] <- 4
> y
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 3
[2,] 2 4
```

- R needs to be given the matrix type, row, and column size
- To change to row-major order, use `byrow`
- This enables the input to change to be more suited for reading and data file organization

```R
> m <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6),nrow=2,byrow=T)
> m
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 1 2 3
[2,] 4 5 6
```

# 3.2 - General Matrix Operations

- Common operations
	- Linear algebra
	- Matrix indexing
	- Matrix filtering

## Performing Linear Algebra Operations on Matrices

- Linear algebra operations
	- Matrix multiplication
	- Matrix scalar multiplication
	- Matrix addition

```R
> y %*% y # mathematical matrix multiplication
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 7 15
[2,]10 22
> 3*y # mathematical multiplication of matrix by scalar
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 3 9
[2,] 6 12
> y+y # mathematical matrix addition
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 2 6
[2,] 4 8
```

## Matrix Indexing

- `z[,2:3]` returns all elements with columns 2 and 3, and any row number


```R
> z
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 1 1 1
[2,] 2 1 0
[3,] 3 0 1
[4,] 4 0 0
> z[,2:3]
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 1
[2,] 1 0
[3,] 0 1
[4,] 0 0
```

- Extracting rows

```R
> y
[,1] [,2]
[1,]11 12
[2,]21 22
[3,]31 32
> y[2:3,]
[,1] [,2]
[1,]21 22
[2,]31 32
> y[2:3,2]
[1] 22 32
```


- Assign values to sub-matrices

```R
> y
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 2 5
[3,] 3 6
> y[c(1,3),] <- matrix(c(1,1,8,12),nrow=2)
> y
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 8
[2,] 2 5
[3,] 1 12
```

```R
> x <- matrix(nrow=3,ncol=3)
> y <- matrix(c(4,5,2,3),nrow=2)
> y
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 4 2
[2,] 5 3
> x[2:3,2:3] <- y
> x
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] NA NA NA
[2,] NA 4 2
[3,] NA 5 3
```

- Negative subscripts are used to exclude elements

```R
> y
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 2 5
[3,] 3 6
> y[-2,]
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 3 6
```

## Extending Example: Image Manipulation

- Images files are matrices, since pixels are arranged in rows and columns
- For each pixel in grayscale, the intensity/brightness is stored
- For a colour image, three matrices are stored
- Use `pixmap` library to read an image

```R
> library(pixmap)
> mtrush1 <- read.pnm("mtrush1.pgm")
> mtrush1
Pixmap image
Type : pixmapGrey
Size : 194x259
Resolution : 1x1
Bounding box : 0 0 259 194
> plot(mtrush1)
> str(mtrush1)
Formal class 'pixmapGrey' [package "pixmap"] with 6 slots
..@ grey : num [1:194, 1:259] 0.278 0.263 0.239 0.212 0.192 ...
..@ channels: chr "grey"
..@ size : int [1:2] 194 259
...
```

- This matrix has 194 rows, and  259 columns
- An have a pixel intensity from 0 to 1
- Use `locator()` to find the coordinates of a mouse click

```R
# adds random noise to img, at the range rows,cols of img; img and the
# return value are both objects of class pixmap; the parameter q
# controls the weight of the noise, with the result being 1-q times the
# original image plus q times the random noise
blurpart <- function(img,rows,cols,q) {
lrows <- length(rows)
lcols <- length(cols)
newimg <- img
randomnoise <- matrix(nrow=lrows, ncol=ncols,runif(lrows*lcols))
newimg@grey <- (1-q) * img@grey + q * randomnoise
return(newimg)
}
```


## Filtering on Matrices

- Filtering can be done with matrices, like vectors

```R
> x
x
[1,] 1 2
[2,] 2 3
[3,] 3 4
> x[x[,2] >= 3,]
x
[1,] 2 3
[2,] 3 4
```


- Computation if completely vectorized operation
	- The object x[,2] is a vector
	- The operator >= compares two vectors
	- The number 3 was recycled to a vector of 3s


```R
> z <- c(5,12,13)
> x[z %% 2 == 1,]
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 3 6
```

```R
> m
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 2 5
[3,] 3 6
> m[m[,1] > 1 & m[,2] > 5,]
[1] 3 6
```

- The result of the filtering is a two-element vector, not a matrix
- Use `drop()` to tell R to retain the 2D data

```R
> m
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 5 -1
[2,] 2 10
[3,] 9 11
> which(m > 2)
[1] 1 3 5 6
```

- R returns the vector-indexing point of view
- Elements 1, 3, 5, and 6 of m are larger than 2

## Extended Example: Generating a Covariance Matrix

- Working with a n-variate normal distribution, the matrix will have n rows and n columns
- Each of the n variables have variance of 1, with correlation `rho` between pair of variables

![](Pasted%20image%2020250619235119.png)

Covariance matrix
- A square matrix that shows the covariance (two random variables) between each pair of elements in a multivariate dataset
- The œÅ (rho) values, also known as the Pearson correlation coefficients, represent the strength and direction of a linear relationship between pairs of variables


```R
makecov <- function(rho,n) {
2 m <- matrix(nrow=n,ncol=n)
3 m <- ifelse(row(m) == col(m),1,rho)
4 return(m)
5 }
```

```R
> z
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 3 6
[2,] 4 7
[3,] 5 8
> row(z)
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 1
[2,] 2 2
[3,] 3 3
```

- The `row() == col()` expression return TRUE and FALSE values
- TRUE on the diagonal, and FALSE elsewhere
- `ifelse(row(m) == col(m),1,rho)`
- This argument checks whether the matrix is square, and replaces and 1 and rho values


# 3.3 - Applying Functions to Matrix Rows and Columns

- `*apply()` functions
	- `apply()`
	- `tapply()`
	- `lapply()`

## Using the apply() Function

- General form of `apply` for matrices

`apply(m,dimcode,f,fargs)`

- `m` is the matrix
- `dimcode` is the dimension, equal to 1 if the function applies to rows or 2 for columns
- `f` is the function applied
- `fargs` is an optional set of arguments for `f`

```R
> z
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 2 5
[3,] 3 6
> apply(z,2,mean)
[1] 2 5
```

```R
> z
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 2 5
[3,] 3 6
> f <- function(x) x/c(2,8)
> y <- apply(z,1,f)
> y
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 0.5 1.000 1.50
[2,] 0.5 0.625 0.75
```

- The `f()` function divides a two-element vector by the vector (2,8)
- The first computation, ends up at the first column in the output, and changes the size of the matrix
- If a function to be applied returns a vector of k components, the result of `apply()` will have k rows
- Use matrix transpose function`t()` to change

```R
> t(apply(z,1,f))
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 0.5 0.500
[2,] 1.0 0.625
[3,] 1.5 0.750
```

- If the function returns a scalar, the final result will be a vector, not a matrix
- There needs to be at least one argument for a function to be applied

```R
> copymaj
function(rw,d) {
maj <- sum(rw[1:d]) / d
return(if(maj > 0.5) 1 else 0)
}
> x
[,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] 1 0 1 1 0
[2,] 1 1 1 1 0
[3,] 1 0 0 1 1
[4,] 0 1 1 1 0
> apply(x,1,copymaj,3)
[1] 1 1 0 1
> apply(x,1,copymaj,2)
[1] 0 1 0 0
```


- The values 3 and 2 form the actual arguments for the formal argument `d`
- `clusterApply()` in the `snow` package gives R some parallel-processing by distributing the submatrix data to various network nodes, with each node applying the given function on its submatrix

## Extended Example: Finding Outliers

- Outliers are data points that differ greatly from most of the other observation
- They are treated as suspect of unrepresentative

```R
1 findols <- function(x) {
2 findol <- function(xrow) {
3 mdn <- median(xrow)
4 devs <- abs(xrow-mdn)
5 return(which.max(devs))
6 }
7 return(apply(x,1,findol))
8 }
```

- `xrow-mdn`, subtracts a number that is a one-element vector from a vector that generally has a length greater than 1
- `which.max()`, determines where the maximum values occurs
- `findol()` applies this to each row of x, producing indices of the most deviant observation in each row


# 3.4 - Adding and Deleting Matrix Rows and Columns


- Matrices are a fixed length and dimension
- Matrices can be reassigned, to achieve additions or deletions

## Changing the Size of a Matrix

- Reassignment occurs during assignment, such as `x[2] <- 12`
- Analogous operations can be used to change the size of a matrix
	- `rbind()`
	- `cbind()`

```R
> one
[1] 1 1 1 1
> z
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 1 1 1
[2,] 2 1 0
[3,] 3 0 1
[4,] 4 0 0
> cbind(one,z)
[1,]1 1 1 1
[2,]1 2 1 0
[3,]1 3 0 1
[4,]1 4 0 0
> cbind(1,z)
[,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,] 1 1 1 1
[2,] 1 2 1 0
[3,] 1 3 0 1
[4,] 1 4 0 0
```

- Recycling of the value 1 will also work

```R
> q <- cbind(c(1,2),c(3,4))
> q
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 3
[2,] 2 4
```

- Creating a vector, or matrix is time consuming
- When a matrix is reassigned
	- A new name is formed, and the old is removed
- Better to allocate a large matrix in the first place and fill it with rows and columns, instead of reassigning matrix and using memory allocation each time

```R
> m <- matrix(1:6,nrow=3)
> m
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 2 5
[3,] 3 6
> m <- m[c(1,3),]
> m
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 3 6
```

## Extended Example: Finding the Closest Pair of Vertices in a Graph

- Finding the distances between vertices on graphs is a common problem
	- Clustering algorithms
	- Genomics application

```R
1 # returns the minimum value of d[i,j], i != j, and the row/col attaining
2 # that minimum, for square symmetric matrix d; no special policy on ties
3 mind <- function(d) {
4 n <- nrow(d)
5 # add a column to identify row number for apply()
6 dd <- cbind(d,1:n)
7 wmins <- apply(dd[-n,],1,imin)
8 # wmins will be 2xn, 1st row being indices and 2nd being values
9 i <- which.min(wmins[2,])
10 j <- wmins[1,i]
11 return(c(d[i,j],i,j))
12 }
13
14 # finds the location, value of the minimum in a row x
15 imin <- function(x) {
16 lx <- length(x)
17 i <- x[lx] # original row number
18 j <- which.min(x[(i+1):(lx-1)])
19 k <- i+j
20 return(c(k,x[k]))
21 }
```

```R
> q
[,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] 0 12 13 8 20
[2,] 12 0 15 28 88
[3,] 13 15 0 6 9
[4,] 8 28 6 0 33
[5,] 20 88 9 33 0
> mind(q)
[1] 6 3 4
```

- The minimum values was 6, located in row 3, column 4
- Find the minimum in each row, and then find the smallest value from those minima
- `imin()`, returns the minimum in the given row, and the index of the value

![](Pasted%20image%2020250620004049.png)

- The second row contains the upper-diagonal minima from the various rows of d, while the first row contains the indices of those values
- In the first column, it shows that the smallest value in that row is 8, occurring at index 4 of the row

```R
minda <- function(d) {
smallest <- min(d)
ij <- which(d == smallest,arr.ind=TRUE)
return(c(smallest,ij))
}
```

- `ij <- which(d == smallest,arr.ind=TRUE)`
- Determines the index of the element of d that achieves the minimum
- `arr.ind` returns a matrix index, instead of a vector value

# 3.5 - More on the Vector/Matrix Distinction

- A matrix is a vector but with rows and numbers

```R
> z <- matrix(1:8,nrow=4)
> z
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 5
[2,] 2 6
[3,] 3 7
[4,] 4 8
```

- The matrix can be queried as a vector

```R
> length(z)
[1] 8
> class(z)
[1] "matrix"
> attributes(z)
$dim
[1] 4 2
```

- There is a matrix class
- Most R consists of S3 classes, whose components are denoted by dollar signed
- The matrix class uses `dim`, which is a vector containing rows and columns

```R
> nrow
function (x)
dim(x)[1]
```

# 3.6 - Avoiding Unintended Dimension Reduction

- Dimension reduction can be useful or not
- `drop` is an argument used to keep the matrix mode

```R
> r <- z[2,, drop=FALSE]
> r
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 2 6
> dim(r)
[1] 1 2
```

```R
> z[3,2]
[1] 7
> "["(z,3,2)
[1] 7
``` 

- Use `as.matrix()` to denote a matrix value

```R
> u
[1] 1 2 3
> v <- as.matrix(u)
> attributes(u)
NULL
> attributes(v)
$dim
[1] 3 1
```

# 3.7 - Naming Matrix Rows and Columns

- The natural way to refer to rows and columns is via numbers
- They can also have names

```R
> z
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 3
[2,] 2 4
> colnames(z)
NULL
> colnames(z) <- c("a","b")
> > z
a b
[1,] 1 3
[2,] 2 4
> colnames(z)
[1] "a" "b"
> z[,"a"]
[1] 1 2
```

- `colnames()`, and `rownames()`

# 3.8 - Higher-Dimensional Arrays

- In R, a higher than two-dimensional data structure is called an array


```R
> firsttest
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 46 30
[2,] 21 25
[3,] 50 48
> secondtest
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 46 43
[2,] 41 35
[3,] 50 49
```

- When both test are put into one data structure, the values are layered

`tests <- array(data=c(firsttest,secondtest),dim=c(3,2,2))`

- Two layers, each consisting of three rows, and two columns

```
> attributes(tests)
$dim
[1] 3 2 2
```

- Each elements has three subscripts
- `[row,col,layer]`

```R
> tests[3,2,1]
[1] 48
```

- Therefore, 4D arrays can be created by combining two or more 3D arrays
- The most common use of arrays is in calculating tables
