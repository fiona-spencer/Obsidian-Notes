**Recycling** - the automatic lengthening of vectors in certain settings
**Filtering** - The extraction of subsets of vectors
**Vectorization** - Where functions are applied element-wise to vectors

# 2.1 - Scalars, Vectors, Arrays, and Matrices

- In many programming languages, vector variables are different from _scalar_
- In R, numbers are considered one-element vectors, and there are not scalars
- R variables types are called modes

Modes
- Integer
- Numeric (floating-point)
- Character (string)
- Logical (boolean)
- Complex

- Use `typeof()` to check the mode variable

- Vector indices in R begin at 1


## Adding and Deleting Vector Elements

- Vectors are stores like arrays in C, contiguously
- Therefore cannot insert or delete elements
- Size of a vector is determined at its creation

```R
x <- c(88,5,12,13)
x <- c(x[1:3],168,x[4])
x
[1] 88 5 12 168 13
```

- This creates a new five-element vector, leaving x intact
- A new vector is created and stores the vector x in a different position
- Functional programming may restrict the potential for fast performance in R

## Obtaining the Length of a Vector

- Use `length()` to obtain the length of a vector

```R
x <- c(1,2,4)
length(x)
[1] 3
```

```R
first1 <- function(x){
	for (i in 1:length(x)){
		if (x[i] == 1) break
	}
	return(i)
}
```

- Writing `for (n in x)` will not work
- When null vector, the length is 0, and then when called again 1
- `seq()` is used instead

## Matrices and Array as Vectors


- Arrays and matrices are vectors
- They have class attributes
- Matrices have the number of rows and columns

```R
> m
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 2
[2,] 3 4

> m + 10:13
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 11 14
[2,] 14 17
```
