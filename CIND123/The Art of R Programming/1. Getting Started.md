- Features of R
	- Public domain implementation of the widely regarded S statistical language
	- Comparable in power to commercial products
	- Object-oriented and functional programming languages

Popular Development Environments
- RStudio
- StatET
- ESS
- R Commander
- JGR

### Object-Oriented Programming
- R is polymorphic
	- A single function can be applied to different types of inputs, which the function processes in a certain way

### Functional Programming
- Avoids explicit iteration


Advantages
- Clearer and more compact code
- Faster execution speed
- Less debugging
- Easier transition to parallel programming


# 1.1 - How to Run R

---

- 2 modes
	- Interactive
	- Batch

## Interactive Mode

- Start an R session by typing `R`

```R
> mean(abs(rnorm(100)))
[1] 0.7194236
```

- Generates 100 random variates, finds the aosolute values, and the mean of the values

- R code files are saved with `.R` or `.r`
- Execute a file with `source("z.R)`


## Batch Mode
- Automate R session

```R
pdf("xh.pdf") #set graphical output file
hist(rnom(100))
dev.off()
```

- Create a graph in PDF file
- Generate 100 N (0,1) random variates
- Draw histogram
- Write file to disk

Run with `R CMD BATCH z.R`

# 1.2 - A First R Session

- Simple data set (in R parlance, a vector)

`x <- c(1,2,4)`

- The standard assignment operator is `<-`, `=` is discouraged
- There are not fixed types associated with variables
- _c_ stands for concatenate

`q <- c(x,x,8)`

- Sets q to (1,2,4,1,2,4,8)
- Individual elements of a vector are accessed via []

`x[3]`
`[1] 4`

- The selector, is the index of subscript
- Subsetting is a important operation on vectors

```R
x <- c(1,2,4)
x[2:3]
[1] 2 4
```

```R
mean(x)
[1] 2.33333
sd(x)
[1] 1.527525
```


Get a list of data sets with `data()`

```R
mean(Nile)
919.35
sd(Nile)
[1] 169.2275
hist(Nile)
```


- To quite the R shell `q()`

# 1.3 - Introduction to Functions


- R programming consists of writing functions
- A function is a group of instructions that takes inputs, uses them to compute other values, and returns a result

```R
# counts the numbers of odd integers in x
oddcount <- function(x) {
	k <- 0
	for (n in x) {
		if (n %% 2 == 1) k <- k+1
	}
	return(k)
}
```


- `return(k)` can also be written as `k`
- x is the formal argument (or formal parameter) of the function
- First function call with values is the actual argument


## Variable Scope

- A variable that is visible only within a function body is local to that function
- k and n are local variables
- To evaluate a function call, R copies each argument to the corresponding local parameter variable, and charges to that variable are not visible outside the function

```R
f <- function(x) return(x+y)
y <- 3
f(5)
[1] 8
```

- y is a global variable
- A global variable can be written to form within a function by using a _superassignment operator (<<-)_

## Default Arguments

- R also makes frequent use of _default argument_

`g <- function(x,y=2,z=T {...}`

- Here y and z have initialized values if not values are called from the function

`g(12,z=FALSE)`

- 12 is the argument for x
- 2 is used as the default value for y
- z is charged to FALSE
- R has Boolean types (logical TRUE and FALSE)
- R allows TRUE and FALSE to T and F

# 1.4 - Preview of Some Important R Data Structures

## Vectors, the R Workhorse

- Vector is the heart of R
- Elements of vectors must have the same _mode_, or data type
	- Character strings
	- Integer elements

### Scalar
- Scalars, or individual numbers, do not really exist in R

## Character Strings

- Character strings are single-element vectors of mode character (rather than mode numeric)

```R
> x <- c(5,12,13)
> x
[1] 5 12 13
> length(x)
[1] 3
> mode(x)
[1] "numeric"
> y <- "abc"
> y
[1] "abc"
> length(y)
[1] 1
> mode(y)
[1] "character"
> z <- c("abc","29 88")
> length(z)
[1] 2
> mode(z)
[1] "character"
```


- y is a one-element vector
- z consists of two strings

```R
u <- paste("abc","de","f") # concatente the strings
u
[1] 'abd de f'
v <- strsplite(u," ") # splite the string according the blanks
v
[[1]]
[1] "abc" "de" "f"
```

## Matrices

- An R matrix corresponds to the mathematical concept of the same name
	- A rectangular array of numbers
	- A matrix is a vector, but with two additional attributes
		- Rows
		- Columns

```R
m <- rbind(c(1,4),c(2,2))
m
[,1] [,2]
[1,] 1 4
[2,] 2 2
m %*% c(1,1)
     [,1]
[1,] 5
[2,] 4
```

- `rbind()` used for row bind to build a matrix from two vectors that are rows
- `cbind()` combines several columns into a matrix
- Matrix-multiplication operator (%\*%)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250611193828.png)

A x B = AB = C
mn np
(2)(2) (2)(1) = 2 x 1 (dimension of C) 

```
1 4   x  1
2 2      1

C11 = (1)(1) + (4)(1)
C21 = (2)(1) + (2)(1)

C = 5
    4
```


- Matrices are indexed using double scripting

```R
m[1,2]
[1] 4
```

- Submatrices from a matrix, lets you extract subvectors from vectors

```R
m[1,]
[1] 1 4
```

## Lists

- R list is container for values, but its contents can be items of different data types
- List elements are accessed using two-part names, which are indicated with the dollar sign $ in R

```R
x <- list(u=2, v="abc")
x
$u
[1] 2
$v
[1] "abc"
x$u
[1] 2
```

- A common use of lists it to combine multiple values into a single package that can be returned by a function
- hist() returns a list with a number of components
- Components describe the characteristics of the histogram
	- `breaks` - bin in the histogram start and end
	- `counts` - number of observations in each bin
- Information is returned into an R list, that can be accessed and manipulated further

```R
hn <- hist(Nile)
str(hm) # more compact version
```

- `str()` stands for structure

## Data Frames

- A typical data set contains data of different modes
- Instead of a matrix, a data frame is used
- A data frame in R is a list, which each component of the list being a vector corresponding to a column in our "matrix" of data

```R
d <- data.frame(list(kids=c("Jack","Jill"),ages=c(12,10))
d
  kids ages
1 Jack 12
1 Jill 10
```

- Typically data frames are created by reading in a data set from a file or database


## Classes

- R is an object-oriented language
- Objects are instances of classes
- Classes are a bit more abstract than data types
- Most of R is based on R's S# classes
- A nongraphical hist() function is a list with components
- There was also an attribute, which specified the class of the list, namely `histogram`

- Classes are used by generic function
- A generic function stands for a family of functions, all serving a similar purpose but each appropriate to a specific class
	- A commonly used genetic function is `summary()`
		- Family of summary-making functions, each handling objects of a particular class
	- `plot()`
		- Plotting function based on object's class
- Classes are used to organize objects

# 1.5 - Extended Example - Regression Analysis of Exam Grades

- Read in the data file

`examsquiz <- read.table("ExamsQuiz.txt",header=FALSE)`

- `header=False`, specifies that there is not header line for the variables

```R
class(examsquiz)
[1] "data.frame"
head(examsquiz)
V1 V2 V3
1 2.0 3.3 4.0
2 3.3 2.0 3.7
3 4.0 4.3 4.0
...
```

```R
lma <- lm(examsquiz[,2] ~ examsquiz[,1])
lma <- lm(examsquiz$V2 ~ examsquiz$V1)
```

- `lm()` for linear model instructs R to fit this prediction equation
	- Exam 2 = $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ Exam 1

- $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are constants to be estimated from the data
- Fitting a straight line to the (exam 1, exam 2) pairs in the data
- Through least-squares
- The results are an object that is stores in `lma`, an is an instance of `lm`
- List components by calling `attributes()`

```R
> attributes(lma)
$names
[1] "coefficients" "residuals" "effects" "rank"
[5] "fitted.values" "assign" "qr" "df.residual"
[9] "xlevels" "call" "terms" "model"
$class
[1] "lm"
```

- Call components with abbreviated names

```R
> lma$coef
(Intercept) examsquiz[, 1]
1.1205209 0.5899803
```

- `print()` is another generic function
- To estimate a predication equation for exam 2 from both the exam 1 and the quiz scores, us +

`lmb <- lm(examsquiz[,2] ~ examsquiz[,1] + examsquiz[,3])`

- `+` is a delimiter in the list of predictor variables

# 1.6 - Startup and Shutdown

- Place R commands in `.Rprofile` located in home directory to run every session
- `options()` is used for configuration
- R uses current working directory
	- Check directory with `getwd()`
	- Set directory with `setwd("/path/folder")`
