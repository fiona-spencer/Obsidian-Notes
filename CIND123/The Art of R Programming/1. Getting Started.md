- Features of R
	- Public domain implementation of the widely regarded S statistical language
	- Comparable in power to commercial products
	- Object-oriented and functional programming languages

Popular Development Environments
- RStudio
- StatET
- ESS
- R Commander
- JGR

### Object-Oriented Programming
- R is polymorphic
	- A single function can be applied to different types of inputs, which the function processes in a certain way

### Functional Programming
- Avoids explicit iteration


Advantages
- Clearer and more compact code
- Faster execution speed
- Less debugging
- Easier transition to parallel programming


# 1.1 - How to Run R

---

- 2 modes
	- Interactive
	- Batch

## Interactive Mode

- Start an R session by typing `R`

```R
> mean(abs(rnorm(100)))
[1] 0.7194236
```

- Generates 100 random variates, finds the aosolute values, and the mean of the values

- R code files are saved with `.R` or `.r`
- Execute a file with `source("z.R)`


## Batch Mode
- Automate R session

```R
pdf("xh.pdf") #set graphical output file
hist(rnom(100))
dev.off()
```

- Create a graph in PDF file
- Generate 100 N (0,1) random variates
- Draw histogram
- Write file to disk

Run with `R CMD BATCH z.R`

# 1.2 - A First R Session

- Simple data set (in R parlance, a vector)

`x <- c(1,2,4)`

- The standard assignment operator is `<-`, `=` is discouraged
- There are not fixed types associated with variables
- _c_ stands for concatenate

`q <- c(x,x,8)`

- Sets q to (1,2,4,1,2,4,8)
- Individual elements of a vector are accessed via []

`x[3]`
`[1] 4`

- The selector, is the index of subscript
- Subsetting is a important operation on vectors

```R
x <- c(1,2,4)
x[2:3]
[1] 2 4
```

```R
mean(x)
[1] 2.33333
sd(x)
[1] 1.527525
```


Get a list of data sets with `data()`

```R
mean(Nile)
919.35
sd(Nile)
[1] 169.2275
hist(Nile)
```


- To quite the R shell `q()`

# 1.3 - Introduction to Functions


- R programming consists of writing functions
- A function is a group of instructions that takes inputs, uses them to compute other values, and returns a result

```R
# counts the numbers of odd integers in x
oddcount <- function(x) {
	k <- 0
	for (n in x) {
		if (n %% 2 == 1) k <- k+1
	}
	return(k)
}
```


- `return(k)` can also be written as `k`
- x is the formal argument (or formal parameter) of the function
- First function call with values is the actual argument


## Variable Scope

- A variable that is visible only within a function body is local to that function
- k and n are local variables
- To evaluate a function call, R copies each argument to the corresponding local parameter variable, and charges to that variable are not visible outside the function

```R
f <- function(x) return(x+y)
y <- 3
f(5)
[1] 8
```

- y is a global variable
- A global variable can be written to form within a function by using a _superassignment operator (<<-)_

## Default Arguments

- R also makes frequent use of _default argument_

`g <- function(x,y=2,z=T {...}`

- Here y and z have initialized values if not values are called from the function
